# New Relic Monitoring Guide for Node.js Applications

## The Scenario: "Project Apollo" E-Commerce API

Let's imagine we have a Node.js backend for an e-commerce platform called "Project Apollo". It's hosted on AWS EC2 instances behind a Load Balancer, and it uses an AWS RDS PostgreSQL instance for its database.

### Current Issues
We've been experiencing:
- Occasional slow response times during flash sales
- Mysterious 500 errors that are hard to reproduce
- Need to understand if our database is the bottleneck

**Our goal**: Configure New Relic to get full visibility into our application's performance and health.

## 1. Configuration: From Scratch

Configuring New Relic involves three main steps:

### Step 1: Create a New Relic Account

Sign up at newrelic.com and create a new account. For a Node.js app, you'll be taken to the "Add your data" screen, which gives you your unique License Key. This key identifies your account and is crucial.

### Step 2: Instrument Your Node.js Application

This is the core setup. You don't need to change your code; you just need to install the agent and configure it.

#### Install the Package
In your project directory, run:

```bash
npm install newrelic --save
```

#### Download/Create the Configuration File

The quickest way is to download the recommended `newrelic.js` file from the New Relic onboarding guide. Place this file at the root of your application.

Alternatively, you can create it manually:

```javascript
// newrelic.js
'use strict'
exports.config = {
  app_name: ['Project Apollo Production'], // This is how your app will appear in the UI
  license_key: 'YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY_HERE', // The key from Step 1
  logging: {
    level: 'info',
    filepath: 'stdout' // Good practice for Docker/ECS environments
  },
  allow_all_headers: true,
  attributes: {
    exclude: [
      'request.headers.cookie',
      'request.headers.authorization',
      'request.headers.proxyAuthorization',
      'request.headers.setCookie*',
      'request.headers.x*',
      'response.headers.cookie',
      'response.headers.authorization',
      'response.headers.proxyAuthorization',
      'response.headers.setCookie*',
      'response.headers.x*'
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Require the Agent at the Top of Your App

This must be the first line of your application's entry point (e.g., `app.js` or `index.js`):

```javascript
// app.js - This must be the FIRST line
require('newrelic');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
// ... rest of your app code
```

### Step 3: Restart Your Application

Deploy the updated code with the new package and configuration file, and restart your Node.js server. The agent will immediately start sending data to New Relic.

Within a minute or two, your application will appear in the New Relic One UI.

## 2. How It Collects Data & Useful Metrics

The New Relic agent is a "mini-scientist" attached to your Node process.

### How it collects

It uses the Node.js Async Hooks API and other instrumentation techniques to wrap important functions (like HTTP server requests and database queries). It measures the time it takes for these operations to complete and gathers context around them, then batches this data and sends it securely to New Relic's collectors every minute.

### Key Metrics It Exposes

#### Apdex (Application Performance Index)
A single score between 0 and 1 (1 is perfect) that measures user satisfaction. It's based on a target response time you set (e.g., 500ms). Responses are rated as:

- **Satisfied**: Faster than the target
- **Tolerating**: Slower than the target but faster than 4x the target
- **Frustrated**: Slower than 4x the target

**Why it's useful**: It's a fantastic high-level health indicator. During a flash sale, you can watch your Apdex score drop, signaling user frustration.

#### Throughput
Requests per minute.

**Why it's useful**: Correlates traffic with performance. "The error rate spiked exactly when we hit 5000 RPM."

#### Error Rate & Error Traces
The percentage of HTTP requests that result in errors (4xx, 5xx) and the full stack trace for each unique error.

**Why it's useful**: This solves the "mysterious 500 error" problem. You can see the exact line of code that failed, the database query that caused it, and the user who experienced it.

#### Response Time
The end-to-end time for requests, broken down into:

- **Web Transaction Time**: Time spent in your Node.js code
- **Database Time**: Time spent waiting on database queries (e.g., to your RDS instance). This is further broken down by query
- **External Time**: Time spent calling other APIs (e.g., payment gateways, shipping calculators)

**Why it's useful**: It tells you where the slowness is. Is it your code, the database, or a third party?

#### Database Metrics
For every SQL query (to RDS), it collects:

- Most time-consuming queries (the "slow queries")
- Query throughput and average duration

**Why it's useful**: Directly identifies database bottlenecks. You can find that one unoptimized `SELECT *` query that's dragging everything down.

#### Host Metrics (from AWS EC2)
CPU %, Memory Usage, Disk I/O. New Relic can pull these directly from AWS CloudWatch.

**Why it's useful**: Confirms if a performance issue is due to underlying infrastructure (e.g., CPU is at 100%).

## 3. How We View and Use It: Solving Real Problems

You log into the New Relic One portal. The UI is powerful. Here's how you'd use it for our scenario:

### Problem 1: "Occasional slow response times during flash sales"

1. You go to the **APM > Summary** page for "Project Apollo Production"
2. You see your Apdex score dropped from 0.98 to 0.7 at 2:00 PM
3. You click on the **Transactions** tab and sort by "Slowest average response time"
4. You identify that the `POST /api/checkout` transaction is the culprit. Its average response time jumped from 800ms to 12 seconds
5. You drill down into the `POST /api/checkout` transaction. In the breakdown, you see that the Database time spiked to 11.5 seconds, dwarfing the web transaction time
6. You scroll to the **Database** section on the same page. It shows the top database operations by time. You find one specific query: `SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE item_id = $1` is taking 95% of the total database time

#### The "Aha!" moment
This query is missing an index on the `item_id` column. It's doing a full table scan on a 10-million-row table every time someone checks out.

#### The Help
You immediately work with your DBA to add an index to the `item_id` column. You then deploy the change. The next flash sale runs smoothly. You can prove your impact by showing the dashboard where the database time for the checkout transaction is now under 50ms.

### Problem 2: "Mysterious 500 errors"

1. You go to the **APM > Errors** page for your application
2. You see a list of errors grouped by type. You notice a `SequelizeDatabaseError: relation "discount_codes" does not exist` is occurring 50 times per minute
3. You click on the error. New Relic shows you the full stack trace, the transaction it occurred in (`GET /api/products`), and even the offending SQL query: `SELECT * FROM discount_codes WHERE code = 'SUMMER20'`
4. You can see samples of the actual requests that caused the error, including the user's IP and session ID

#### The "Aha!" moment
A developer deployed a feature that tries to check a discount code table, but that table was never created in the production RDS database! The code wasn't properly error-handled.

#### The Help
You roll back the faulty deployment and create a ticket to add proper database migration checks and error handling. You've just turned a "mystery" into a known, fixable bug.

## How to Explain This in an Interview

> "In my previous project, we used New Relic for monitoring our Node.js APIs on AWS. My responsibility was to instrument the application, which involved installing the newrelic package, adding a config file with our license key, and requiring it at the top of our app entry point.
>
> It gave us incredible visibility. For example, we were seeing slow performance during sales events. Using New Relic's transaction breakdown, I was able to drill down from a dropping Apdex score directly to a single problematic database query against our RDS instance that was missing an index. We added the index and resolved the bottleneck.
>
> It was also invaluable for error tracking. Instead of sifting through logs, we could go directly to the Errors page, see the exact stack trace for a 500 error, and even see which user and request triggered it. It turned debugging from a guessing game into a targeted investigation."

This approach shows you didn't just set it upâ€”you used it to derive value and solve real business problems.
