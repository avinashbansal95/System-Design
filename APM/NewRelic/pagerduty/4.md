# PagerDuty Escalation Policy Creation Guide

This is a key operational process. Let's break down who does it and how it's built.

## Who Creates the Escalation Policy?

**Answer:** Typically, this is done by a **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)**, **DevOps Lead**, **Engineering Manager**, or a **PagerDuty Administrator**. It's not usually created by individual contributors. 

This person has the organizational knowledge to define:
- Who is responsible for a service
- The order of escalation (who gets called first, second, etc.)
- The correct rotation schedules

Once the policy is created, individual engineers are added to it (either directly or via a schedule).

## How is an Escalation Policy Created? (Step-by-Step)

Let's walk through the process an admin would follow. The goal is to create a policy that ensures 24/7 coverage without overburdening any single person.

### Step 1: Define the Rotation Schedules

Before you can build a good policy, you need to define who is on call and when.

1. The admin goes to **Schedules** in PagerDuty and creates a new schedule (e.g., "Primary Production On-Call")
2. They add users to this schedule (e.g., all members of the "Order Service Team") and define the rotation (e.g., "Rotates every week")
3. They might create a second schedule for "Secondary Production On-Call" or "Team Lead On-Call"

### Step 2: Create the Escalation Policy

1. The admin navigates to **Configuration → Services → Escalation Policies** and clicks **New Escalation Policy**
2. **Name:** They give it a clear name, e.g., "E-Commerce Platform Production Escalation"
3. **Description:** (Optional) "Escalation path for all critical alerts related to the e-commerce platform"

### Step 3: Add Escalation Levels (The Core of the Policy)

This is where the admin defines the "who" and "when". Yes, people (or schedules) are added to each level.

#### Level 1:
- **Target:** The admin adds the "Primary Production On-Call" Schedule. This is better than adding a person directly, as the schedule automatically rotates
- **Escalation Timeout:** 15 minutes. This means PagerDuty will try to notify the primary on-call person for 15 minutes. If they don't acknowledge, it escalates to Level 2

#### Level 2:
- **Target:** The admin adds the "Secondary Production On-Call" Schedule or a specific person like "John Doe (Team Lead)"
- **Escalation Timeout:** 10 minutes. If the primary doesn't respond in 15 min, the secondary gets a faster escalation (10 min)

#### Level 3:
- **Target:** The admin adds a broader group or management, e.g., "Engineering Management Schedule" or "All SREs"
- **Escalation Timeout:** 0 minutes. This means if the incident reaches this level, it immediately notifies everyone in that group. This is for true emergencies where the service is completely down

### Step 4: Assign the Policy to a Service

The final step is to edit the PagerDuty Service (e.g., "Order Service") and, in its configuration, select the new escalation policy from a dropdown menu.

Now, any alert coming into that service will follow this precise escalation path.

## How People Get Added to the Policy (The Two Methods)

People are never directly added to a policy. They are added indirectly through one of two ways:

### Via a Schedule (Most Common & Recommended):
- The admin adds a user to a **Schedule** (e.g., "Primary On-Call")
- Then, the admin adds that **Schedule** as a target in the Escalation Policy
- This is the best practice. It allows the on-call duty to rotate automatically among a group of people without having to edit the policy every week

### Via Direct User Assignment (Less Common):
- The admin can add a specific **User** (e.g., "Jane Smith") directly as a target in an escalation level
- This is generally avoided because it's static. If Jane leaves the company or changes teams, the policy breaks and must be manually updated
- It's only used for fixed roles like a specific manager who is always the final point of contact

## A Real-World Example of an Escalation in Action

### Policy: "E-Commerce Platform Production Escalation"

| Level | Target | Timeout |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Level 1** | "Primary On-Call Schedule" | 15 minutes |
| **Level 2** | "Team Lead On-Call Schedule" | 10 minutes |
| **Level 3** | "Head of Engineering" (User) | 0 minutes |

### Scenario:

**12:00 AM:** A critical alert triggers.

**12:00 AM:** PagerDuty starts notifying **Sarah**, who is the current primary on-call according to the schedule. Push, then call, then SMS.

**12:15 AM:** Sarah is in a dead zone and gets no notifications. The 15-minute timeout elapses.

**12:15 AM:** PagerDuty escalates to Level 2 and starts notifying **Diego**, the Team Lead. He gets a call and wakes up. He acknowledges the alert.

**12:16 AM:** Diego investigates, sees Sarah wasn't available, and starts working on the issue. The escalation stops at Level 2 because he acknowledged it.

**(Worst Case):** If Diego also didn't respond by 12:25 AM, PagerDuty would escalate to Level 3 and immediately call the Head of Engineering, waking them up for a full-blown emergency.

## Why This Structure Works

This structure ensures that:

- **The right people are called in the right order**
- **No single person can become a bottleneck** for incident response
- **Coverage is maintained** even when primary contacts are unavailable
- **Escalation intensity increases** appropriately with time and severity
- **Management is only involved** when truly necessary

The combination of schedules and escalation policies creates a robust, automated system for ensuring critical production issues always receive prompt attention from qualified responders.
