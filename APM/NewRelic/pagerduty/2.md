# PagerDuty Escalation and Notification Configuration Guide

PagerDuty has the capability to call, send SMS (text messages), and email the on-call person, and it will escalate if the alert is not acknowledged. This is a key feature that makes it so powerful for critical alerting.

## How PagerDuty Gets the Alert to the End User

PagerDuty's notification system is based on **rules** and **escalation policies**. It doesn't just send one notification; it follows a precise sequence to ensure someone always responds.

### The Process Flow

1. **Alert is Received:** New Relic sends an alert to PagerDuty via the integration

2. **PagerDuty Creates an Incident:** This incident is assigned to an Escalation Policy

3. **The Escalation Policy is Triggered:**

#### Step 1: Notify Primary On-Call
PagerDuty looks at the policy to see who is currently "on-call" first. It attempts to notify that person through their **User Notification Rules**.

**The "Phone Tree":** PagerDuty will follow the user's specified rules. For example:

- **Immediately:** Push notification to the PagerDuty mobile app
- **After 2 minutes if no response:** Place a voice call to their primary phone
- **After 5 more minutes if no response:** Send an SMS
- **After 5 more minutes if no response:** Call their secondary phone

#### Step 2: Escalate
If the primary on-call person does not acknowledge the incident within a configured timeout (e.g., 15 minutes), PagerDuty escalates the incident to the next person in the escalation policy (e.g., the team lead) and repeats the notification process for them.

**This continues until the alert is acknowledged.**

This process ensures that a critical alert is never missed.

## How to Configure User Notification Rules (The "How to call/email me")

This configuration is done by each individual user in their own PagerDuty settings.

### Step 1: Add Contact Methods

A user must first tell PagerDuty how to contact them.

1. Log into PagerDuty
2. Click on your **profile icon** in the top-right and select **User Settings**
3. Go to the **Contact Information** tab
4. Here, you can **Add Phone Contact** or **Add Email Contact**
5. For a phone, you must add the number and then **verify it**. PagerDuty will call or text you with a code to confirm the number is correct and that they can use it for alerts.

### Step 2: Set Notification Rules

Now, the user defines the order and timing of those contact methods.

1. In **User Settings**, go to the **Notification Rules** tab
2. Click **Add Notification Rule**
3. You will build a rule sequence. For a **"High-Urgency"** alert (which is what New Relic critical alerts will be), you typically want a very aggressive rule.

#### Example of a Strong Notification Rule for Critical Alerts:

If a high-urgency incident is assigned to me:

| Action | Contact Method | Wait Time |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | Push Notification | 0 minutes |
| 2 | Phone Call | 2 minutes |
| 3 | SMS | 5 minutes |
| 4 | Phone Call (secondary number) | 5 minutes |

This means if you don't acknowledge the push notification within 2 minutes, PagerDuty will start calling you.

## How to Configure the Escalation Policy (The "Who to call")

This is configured by a PagerDuty administrator. The escalation policy is the heart of the on-call process.

### Step 1: Create an Escalation Policy

1. In PagerDuty, go to **Configuration → Services → Escalation Policies**
2. Click **New Escalation Policy**
3. Name it (e.g., "Production Primary On-Call")
4. Add escalation levels:

#### Escalation Levels Configuration:

- **Level 1:** Add a user or a schedule (e.g., "Primary On-Call Engineer")
  - Set the escalation timeout for this level (e.g., 15 minutes)
  - This is how long PagerDuty will try to notify this person before moving to the next level

- **Level 2:** Add the next point of contact (e.g., "Team Lead" or "Secondary Engineer")
  - Set another timeout

- **Level 3:** Add a final point of contact (e.g., "Engineering Manager")

### Step 2: Assign the Policy to a Service

1. The PagerDuty **Service** you created for the New Relic integration (e.g., "E-Commerce Platform") has a field for **Escalation Policy**
2. You must assign your new "Production Primary On-Call" policy to this service
3. This links the two: **"When an alert comes in for this service, use this policy to decide who to call"**

## Summary: The Complete Flow

Here's how everything works together from alert to resolution:

### The Complete Process

1. **New Relic** detects a critical error and triggers an incident

2. **New Relic** sends the alert to the PagerDuty Service via the integration key

3. **The PagerDuty Service** looks at its assigned Escalation Policy

4. **The policy starts** with Level 1: Primary On-Call

5. **PagerDuty** looks at that user's Notification Rules and starts executing them:
   - Push → Call → SMS

6. **If the user acknowledges** the alert in the mobile app or by phone:
   - The incident is marked as acknowledged
   - The escalation stops

7. **If the timeout is reached** (e.g., 15 min) with no acknowledgement:
   - The policy escalates to Level 2
   - Repeats the notification process for the next person

### Why This Approach Works

This automated, multi-layered approach is why companies rely on PagerDuty for managing critical infrastructure alerts. It removes the single point of failure of hoping one person sees an email or Slack message.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Guaranteed delivery** through multiple channels
- **Automatic escalation** if primary contact is unavailable
- **Persistent notification** until acknowledged
- **Clear audit trail** of who was notified when
- **No single point of failure** in critical alerting

This system ensures that critical production issues are always addressed promptly, regardless of individual availability or notification preferences.
