if message is remain ther eand does not deleted in kafka or sqs, how system know we do not need to deliver this message? how they move on from that messages

# How Message Systems Know to Move On: Kafka vs SQS vs Pub/Sub

## 1. Kafka

### Core idea:
- Kafka stores **all messages** in a partition log until retention kicks in
- Kafka itself does **not know** which consumer has processed what
- Instead, consumers manage **offsets** (the position in the log)

### How Kafka "moves on":
- Each consumer group maintains its **committed offset** per partition (in the `__consumer_offsets` topic)
- The **committed offset = last processed + 1**
- When a consumer polls, Kafka delivers messages starting from that offset

ðŸ‘‰ So if consumer has committed offset = 43, Kafka won't re-deliver messages 0â€“42 (though they still exist in log).

### Why it works:
- Consumers only **read forward** from their last committed offset
- Old messages are physically still in the log (useful for replay, reprocessing, or new consumer groups)
- But operationally, Kafka "moves on" by **not re-sending messages below the committed offset** to that consumer group

âœ… **Answer for interview:** Kafka doesn't delete on ACK; instead, it tracks **consumer offsets** to know where each group left off. Messages remain in log for retention but aren't re-delivered once offsets move past them.

## 2. AWS SQS

### Core idea:
- SQS is a **queue service**, so a message is considered "in-flight" once delivered
- Messages are not deleted until explicitly deleted by consumer

### How SQS "moves on":
- When a consumer calls `ReceiveMessage`, SQS marks the message **invisible** for the configured **VisibilityTimeout**
- During this time, no other consumer can see it
- If consumer calls `DeleteMessage` â†’ message is gone permanently
- If consumer **does not delete** within VisibilityTimeout â†’ message becomes visible again, eligible for redelivery

ðŸ‘‰ So the system "moves on" **only if consumer deletes it**. Otherwise, SQS assumes you still need it and makes it visible again after the timeout.

### Why it works:
- Explicit deletion ensures no message is dropped accidentally (default = at-least-once)
- If consumer crashes mid-processing, the message reappears, so another consumer can retry

âœ… **Answer for interview:** SQS doesn't automatically move past a message. A consumer must explicitly `DeleteMessage`. If not deleted before VisibilityTimeout, the message reappears and may be re-delivered.

## 3. Compare with Pub/Sub

For completeness:
- **Pub/Sub** doesn't keep offsets. Instead, it uses **ACKs**
- Once a subscriber ACKs a message â†’ Pub/Sub deletes it from that subscription â†’ system knows to move on
- If not ACKed â†’ redelivers after `ackDeadlineSeconds`

## ðŸ”‘ Side-by-Side Summary

| System | How it "knows" to move on |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **Kafka** | Consumer commits offset â†’ broker delivers only from that offset forward. Old messages remain but aren't re-delivered. |
| **SQS** | Consumer must call `DeleteMessage`. If not, after VisibilityTimeout the message becomes visible again. |
| **Pub/Sub** | Subscriber must ACK. After ACK, message is deleted from subscription. |

## 4. Real-life Analogy

- **Kafka:** Like a Netflix series â€” the episodes remain on the server, but your profile remembers you finished Episode 5 and starts at Episode 6.

- **SQS:** Like a to-do app â€” tasks don't disappear until you explicitly click "Done". If you forget, they pop back up later as overdue.

- **Pub/Sub:** Like Gmail â€” once you click "Mark as done" (ACK), the mail disappears from inbox.
