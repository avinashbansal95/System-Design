# SQS FIFO Message Ordering with MessageGroupId

## 1. Not 1M Subscriptions

- SQS FIFO queues don't create new **subscriptions** (like Pub/Sub does) or new **partitions** (like Kafka does).
- You still have **one FIFO queue**.
- Inside that queue, messages are tagged with a `MessageGroupId`.

## 2. What Really Happens Under the Hood

- SQS guarantees **per-MessageGroupId ordering**.
- You can think of each unique `MessageGroupId` as a **virtual ordered stream** inside the same queue.
- Messages from the same `MessageGroupId` are processed **sequentially** (one consumer at a time).
- Messages from **different MessageGroupIds** can be processed **in parallel** by multiple consumers.

So:
- 1M different `MessageGroupId`s = 1M independent ordered streams, all inside a single queue.
- AWS doesn't spin up 1M "subscriptions" — it just enforces per-group sequencing.

## 3. Banking Example with Many Accounts

Let's say you model **accountId as MessageGroupId**.

- `account-12345` → all transactions delivered in order.
- `account-67890` → delivered in order, independently of 12345.
- If you have 1M accounts, you might have 1M MessageGroupIds → each account's events are ordered, but accounts are processed in parallel by your consumer fleet.

## 4. Throughput Limits with Many MessageGroupIds

- **SQS FIFO throughput:** 300 msg/sec (3,000 with batching) **per queue**, but also **per MessageGroupId** concurrency is strictly one-at-a-time.
- So if you have 1M groups and enough consumers, you can process different groups in parallel — but each group is sequential.
- Unlike Kafka (where partitions are fixed, e.g., 1K partitions max), SQS FIFO scales to huge numbers of MessageGroupIds dynamically.

## 5. Analogy to Kafka

- **Kafka:** fixed **partitions** upfront (say 1K partitions). Each partition = ordered log. Partition count limits scaling.
- **SQS FIFO:** dynamic **MessageGroupId** values = virtual partitions. No need to pre-provision, can have 1M+, but concurrency is capped per group.

✅ **So to answer your question:** If there are **1M MessageGroupIds**, you get **1M ordered streams inside one queue**, not 1M subscriptions.
