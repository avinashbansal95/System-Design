i'm a bit confused
here are too many things first is wiredtiger internal cache,journal and main disk

explain me the when journal is set to true
where is the exact journey of write and where it get eventually stored
also you mentioned it takes snapshot every 60 sec and write that to disk. 
from where it takes snapshot of?
also journal is present in hard disk like ssd or in ram?
explain me the relvanxe in terms of performnce


# MongoDB Performance Deep Dive: Write Journey & Storage

Excellent questions. This is a common point of confusion, and getting it crystal clear is key to understanding database performance. Let's break it down step-by-step with a clear analogy.

## The Perfect Analogy: A Librarian and a Ledger

Imagine a library (your database).

- **The Main Bookshelves** (the data files on disk - SSD/HDD): This is where all the books (your data) are permanently stored. It's robust but slow to access.

- **The Librarian's Desk** (the WiredTiger Internal Cache in RAM): This is a small, fast-access desk where the librarian places the most popular books and the index cards. Anything on this desk can be accessed instantly.

- **The Ledger Book** (the Journal on disk): This is a special, sequential logbook where the librarian immediately jots down every single change before doing anything else. "Added Book X," "Moved Book Y to Shelf Z."

## The Write Journey: Step-by-Step with the Analogy

Let's trace a request to add a new book (insert a new document).

### 1. Client Request
You give the librarian a new book to add.

### 2. Update the Desk (Cache - RAM)
The librarian places the new book on their desk. This is very fast. The book is now "in the library" from the perspective of anyone who asks, but it's not yet safely on the main shelves.

### 3. Write to the Ledger (Journal - Disk)
**BEFORE doing anything else**, the librarian immediately writes the action "Added new book: [Title]" in the ledger book. This write is fast because the ledger is a simple, sequential log.

This step is the **durability guarantee**. Even if an earthquake hits right after this (a crash), the librarian knows the book needs to be added and can do it when the library reopens.

> **Important**: The journal is on the main disk (SSD/HDD), not in RAM. RAM is volatile; the journal must be on non-volatile storage to survive a crash.

### 4. Acknowledgment
Once the entry is written to the ledger, the librarian can tell you, "Okay, I've got it!" This is the write acknowledgment sent back to your application.

### 5. The Slow Shelf Update (Checkpoint - Disk)
Now, the librarian can do the slower job of walking over to the main bookshelves and finding a place for the new book. This is the **checkpoint**. It's a bulk operation that updates the main data files on disk to reflect all the changes that are already logged in the journal and sitting on the desk.

The "snapshot" is taken from the librarian's desk (the in-memory cache). The cache in RAM has the most recent, consistent state of all data. Every 60 seconds (or after 2GB of journal data), WiredTiger says, "Okay, let's take everything that's currently on the desk and make sure the main shelves are updated to match it."

## Direct Answers to Your Questions

### Q1: Where is the exact journey of a write and where does it get stored?

1. **In-Memory Cache (RAM)** → 2. **Journal File (Disk)** → (Acknowledgment) → ...later... → 3. **Data Files (Disk)**

The data is permanently stored in the **Data Files**. The **Journal** is a temporary log for crash recovery.

### Q2: From where does it take the snapshot (for a checkpoint)?

It takes the snapshot from the **WiredTiger Internal Cache (RAM)**. The cache holds the latest, most consistent version of the data. The checkpoint process writes this in-memory state to the data files on disk.

### Q3: Is the journal on an SSD or in RAM?

The journal is **always on the main disk (preferably an SSD)**. It must be on non-volatile storage. If it were in RAM, it would be wiped clean on a power loss and couldn't be used for recovery. The whole point of the journal is to survive a crash.

## Relevance in Terms of Performance & Trade-Offs

This architecture is all about performance optimization. Here's how:

| Component | Performance Impact & Trade-Offs |
|-----------|--------------------------------|
| **Journal (on Disk)** | **PRO**: Makes writes durable without forcing every single write to wait for the slow main data files. The sequential write to the journal is much faster than a random write to the data files.<br><br>**CON**: There's still a disk write. You can tune this. `j: true` (default) = wait for journal write (safe). `j: false` = don't wait (very fast, but risk losing ~100ms of data on crash). |
| **WiredTiger Cache (RAM)** | **PRO**: Massive read performance. All reads are served from RAM if the data is cached. Good write performance. Writes are applied in memory first, which is instant.<br><br>**CON**: Cost. RAM is expensive. If your working set (active data + indexes) is larger than your RAM, you'll get "cache misses" and performance will tank as it reads from disk. |
| **Checkpointing** | **PRO**: Efficient disk I/O. By batching changes and writing them to the main data files in large chunks, it avoids the performance killer of many small, random writes.<br><br>**CON**: If the system crashes before a checkpoint, the journal replay on startup takes longer (because there's more to replay). The 60-second interval is a balance between performance and recovery time. |
| **Data Files (on Disk)** | **PRO**: Permanent, efficient storage. Compression saves space and reduces the amount of data that needs to be read/written.<br><br>**CON**: Slow. Disk is the slowest part of the system. The entire architecture is designed to minimize access to this layer. |
