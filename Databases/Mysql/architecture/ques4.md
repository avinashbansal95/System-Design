so when an uodate happens it stays in buffer pool and then could be uodated in disk later. so if any read happens immedialtely it must be found in buffer pool right? also i have one more doubt let's say our buffer pool size < active data so if any insert command runs then it wpuld be happen on disk right not on buffer pool?

# ðŸ“Œ MySQL Buffer Pool Operations

## ðŸ“Œ 1. When You Update a Row

* Yes âœ…:
   * Update changes the page in the **Buffer Pool** (if not already there).
   * Page is marked **dirty**.
   * Write is also recorded in **Redo Log** (for crash recovery).
* Any **read immediately after** will read from the **Buffer Pool** (the latest, correct version).

ðŸ‘‰ Reads don't go back to disk if the page is already in Buffer Pool â€” they always see the updated (dirty) version in RAM.

## ðŸ“Œ 2. When Buffer Pool < Active Data

This is the tricky part âš¡.

### Case A: Read query
* If the requested page is not in Buffer Pool â†’ MySQL **evicts some other page** (possibly writing it back if dirty) and **loads the needed page from disk**.
* Once loaded, query runs on that page in RAM.

ðŸ‘‰ Even if Buffer Pool is smaller than dataset, **all operations still go through Buffer Pool**.

### Case B: Insert query
* Inserts also go through **Buffer Pool** (not directly to disk).
* If the target page (like the leaf node of the B+Tree index where the row must go) is not in Buffer Pool:
   1. MySQL **reads the page from disk into Buffer Pool**.
   2. Applies the insert in memory.
   3. Marks page dirty.

ðŸ‘‰ Insert is **not written directly to disk** â€” it's still memory first. Disk write happens later when dirty pages are flushed (checkpoint or eviction).

## ðŸ“Œ 3. So What Happens if Buffer Pool is Too Small?

* **High page churn**: constant eviction/loading of pages.
* Each insert may cause disk I/O to bring in a page.
* Performance drops because of **disk seeks**.

ðŸ‘‰ This is why performance is best when **hot data + indexes fit in Buffer Pool**.

## ðŸ“Œ 4. Analogy

Think of Buffer Pool like a **kitchen counter**:
* Every time you want to cook (query), you bring ingredients (pages) from the pantry (disk).
* If the counter is big enough, you keep everything handy â†’ super fast.
* If the counter is too small, you keep swapping things in/out from the pantry â†’ much slower.

## ðŸŽ¯ Interview-Safe Answer

When an update happens, it's applied in the Buffer Pool, and any subsequent reads see the updated data immediately from memory. The page is later flushed to disk asynchronously. Even inserts always go through the Buffer Pool â€” they are not written directly to disk. If the Buffer Pool is smaller than the active dataset, MySQL must constantly evict pages and fetch new ones from disk, which increases I/O and hurts performance. This is why Buffer Pool sizing is critical for MySQL performance.
