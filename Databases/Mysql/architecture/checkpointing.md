is there an checkpoint machanism in mysql rhat we have in mongodb in 60 sec? how does the data in disk is updated from buffer pool? also when checkoint happens , does redo logs before that are deleted?


# ðŸ“Œ Checkpoint Mechanism in MySQL (InnoDB)

## ðŸ”‘ 1. Why Checkpoints Exist

* Writes in MySQL first land in **Buffer Pool (RAM)** â†’ pages marked **dirty**.
* Redo logs guarantee durability but **cannot grow forever**.
* To free redo log space, MySQL must eventually flush dirty pages to disk. 

ðŸ‘‰ That process = **checkpointing**.

## ðŸ”‘ 2. How Data Moves from Buffer Pool â†’ Disk

1. A page is updated in Buffer Pool â†’ marked **dirty**.
2. Update logged in **Redo Log**.
3. At checkpoint:
   * Dirty pages are **flushed** from Buffer Pool â†’ disk (`.ibd` table files).
   * InnoDB guarantees that all changes up to a specific **LSN (Log Sequence Number)** are persisted.

ðŸ‘‰ After this, redo log entries â‰¤ that LSN are no longer needed for crash recovery.

## ðŸ”‘ 3. Types of Checkpoints in InnoDB

* **Sharp checkpoint**: Flush everything at once (old style, slow).
* **Fuzzy checkpoint (default)**: Flush only some dirty pages incrementally.
   * Runs in the background â†’ smoother performance.
* **Flush on eviction**: If buffer pool full, flush dirty pages before eviction.
* **Flush at log capacity**: If redo log getting full, force flushing.

## ðŸ”‘ 4. Checkpoint Frequency

* Unlike MongoDB's WiredTiger (default checkpoint ~every 60s),
* InnoDB's checkpointing is **adaptive and continuous**:
   * Based on redo log usage.
   * Based on dirty page percentage.
   * Based on background thread activity.

ðŸ‘‰ So not a strict "every 60 seconds" rule, but constantly working in the background.

## ðŸ”‘ 5. Redo Log Cleanup

* Redo logs are **circular** (fixed size, e.g., 1GB).
* After a checkpoint, redo log entries â‰¤ checkpoint LSN are no longer needed â†’ can be **overwritten**.
* Only redo log entries **after the last checkpoint** are required for crash recovery.

ðŸ‘‰ This prevents redo log from growing endlessly.

# ðŸ“Œ Example Walkthrough

1. **Update:**
   ```sql
   UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
   ```
   * Buffer Pool: page dirty (`balance=900`).
   * Redo Log: "subtract 100 from id=1."

2. Many more updates â†’ redo log fills up.

3. InnoDB triggers **checkpoint**:
   * Flushes dirty pages to disk.
   * Updates checkpoint LSN = last durable change.
   * Redo logs before LSN are now reusable.

ðŸ‘‰ After crash, MySQL only needs redo logs **after the last checkpoint** to recover.

# ðŸ“Œ Comparison to MongoDB

* **MongoDB WiredTiger**:
   * Creates a **checkpoint every 60s** (default).
   * Journal + last checkpoint used for recovery.
   
* **MySQL InnoDB**:
   * Checkpointing is **continuous, adaptive** (not fixed interval).
   * Uses redo logs + dirty page flushing.
   * Redo log entries before checkpoint LSN are discarded.

# ðŸŽ¯ Interview-Safe Answer

MySQL InnoDB uses checkpointing just like MongoDB, but instead of a fixed 60s interval, it runs continuously and adaptively. When a page in the buffer pool is modified, it's marked dirty and logged in the redo log. At checkpoints, InnoDB flushes dirty pages to disk and advances the checkpoint LSN. After that, redo log entries before the checkpoint are no longer needed and can be overwritten, since the data is now safely on disk. This prevents the redo log from growing indefinitely and ensures crash recovery only needs the portion after the last checkpoint.
