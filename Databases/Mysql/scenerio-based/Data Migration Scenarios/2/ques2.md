# Cross-Region MySQL Migration: US to EU for GDPR Compliance

Perfect ðŸš€ â€” this is a classic cross-region migration problem that big tech runs into all the time when compliance/regulations require data residency (e.g., GDPR in the EU).

ðŸ‘‰ "You want to migrate a 10TB MySQL database from us-east-1 to eu-west-1 for compliance, with minimal downtime."

Let's build this out step by step from scratch with a real-world example.

## ðŸ”¹ 1. The Challenge

- **10TB database = huge** â†’ dumping + reloading with mysqldump or import will take days, not acceptable.
- **Continuous writes happening in US** (us-east-1) â†’ can't freeze DB for hours.
- **Compliance** (GDPR, local data laws) requires all future writes to land in Europe (eu-west-1).
- We want **minimal downtime** during cutover.

## ðŸ”¹ 2. High-Level Strategy

The standard approach is:

1. **Take baseline copy** of RDS MySQL (10TB).
   - Using snapshot or AWS Database Migration Service (DMS).
2. **Stream ongoing changes** (binlog replication or DMS CDC) from US â†’ EU.
3. **Catch up replication lag** until it's nearly 0.
4. **Cutover traffic** to new EU cluster during a short downtime window.
5. **Validate and decommission** old DB once migration stable.

## ðŸ”¹ 3. AWS Tools Available

### Cross-Region Read Replica (CRR) in RDS MySQL
- Create replica in eu-west-1 directly.
- Asynchronous replication (binlogs).

### AWS DMS (Database Migration Service)
- Continuous data replication (CDC from binlogs).
- Good for heterogeneous migrations (MySQL â†’ Aurora, MySQL â†’ PostgreSQL).

### Aurora Global Database (if target is Aurora, not plain RDS MySQL)
- Near real-time (<1s lag) replication across regions.

ðŸ‘‰ Since source is **RDS MySQL** (not Aurora), the best fit = **Cross-Region Read Replica**.

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Step-by-Step Migration Plan

### âœ… Step 1: Prep the Source (us-east-1)

Ensure binary logging is enabled:

In parameter group:
```
binlog_format = ROW
binlog_row_image = FULL
```

- Ensure storage + IOPS can handle replication load.
- Take a manual snapshot for backup before migration.

### âœ… Step 2: Create Cross-Region Read Replica

In RDS Console:
1. Select source DB (us-east-1).
2. Action â†’ "Create read replica."
3. Choose **Destination Region = eu-west-1**.

AWS will:
- Take a snapshot of the source (baseline).
- Restore it into eu-west-1.
- Set up binlog replication to stream ongoing changes.

ðŸ‘‰ Now you have:
- **Primary** in us-east-1.
- **Cross-region replica** in eu-west-1.

### âœ… Step 3: Let Replica Catch Up

Replication runs asynchronously (binlogs).

Check replication lag:
```sql
SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G
```

- Look at `Seconds_Behind_Master`.
- In CloudWatch: monitor `ReplicaLag`.

ðŸ‘‰ Migration can take **hours/days** for 10TB, but it's streaming in background.

### âœ… Step 4: Plan Cutover Window

Choose a **low-traffic maintenance window**.

Notify stakeholders of a brief read-only period.

Steps:
1. Set source DB (us-east-1) to **read-only**.
2. Wait for replication lag on replica (eu-west-1) â†’ **0**.
3. **Promote replica** in eu-west-1 to standalone DB:
   ```bash
   aws rds promote-read-replica --db-instance-identifier my-eu-db
   ```
4. **Switch application DB endpoint** (in Kubernetes secrets/configmaps) to new EU endpoint.
5. **Rollout restart** services (`kubectl rollout restart`).

ðŸ‘‰ **Downtime = just the cutover period** (few minutes).

### âœ… Step 5: Validate New Primary (eu-west-1)

Run **data consistency checks**:
- Row counts by table.
- Checksums (e.g., `pt-table-checksum`).

**Run app smoke tests**: login, create order, etc.

**Monitor**: CPU, queries, errors.

### âœ… Step 6: Decommission Old US Database

Once you're confident:
- Delete old us-east-1 RDS (or keep read-only replica if needed for fallback/analytics).
- Update IAM policies / security groups to restrict data access in US.

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Real-Life Example: E-Commerce Migration

**Company**: US-based e-commerce, expanding to EU â†’ must comply with GDPR (all EU customer data must reside in EU).

**Current DB**: `orders` table with 10TB data in us-east-1.

**Plan**:
1. Create cross-region read replica in eu-west-1.
2. Let it sync (~2 days).
3. **Maintenance window**: freeze writes in US.
4. Promote EU replica â†’ standalone.
5. Update DNS + Kubernetes secrets to point EU services to new DB.
6. Delete US DB (to ensure compliance).

ðŸ‘‰ **Result**: EU customers' data fully in EU, **downtime < 10 minutes**.

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Rollback Plan

If migration fails after cutover:
- Switch app back to US DB (still available).
- Promote a new replica if needed.
- Always keep US DB until EU DB runs stable for **a few days**.

## ðŸ”¹ 7. Alternatives

- If source was **Aurora** â†’ use **Aurora Global Database** (near-zero lag, even faster).
- If compliance allows dual storage temporarily â†’ run both DBs active-active, then deprecate US later.
- If schema changes needed â†’ combine with **DMS**.

## âœ… Summary

To migrate 10TB RDS MySQL from us-east-1 â†’ eu-west-1:

1. **Enable binlogs**.
2. **Create Cross-Region Read Replica** in eu-west-1.
3. **Let it sync** (hours/days).
4. **During cutover**: make US DB read-only, wait for lag=0, promote EU replica, switch app endpoints.
5. **Validate & decommission** US DB.

ðŸ‘‰ **Downtime = only the cutover window**.
