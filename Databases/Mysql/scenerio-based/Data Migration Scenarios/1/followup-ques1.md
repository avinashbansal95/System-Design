but when we taking snapshot and apply then there could be few new entries in rds that are not in snapshot

# Why Snapshot Alone Isn't Enough: The Complete Migration Strategy

Exactly ⚡ — you've spotted the **key problem** with snapshot-based migrations:

👉 A snapshot is just a **point-in-time copy** of your RDS MySQL.
* If you restore snapshot → Aurora, it's **frozen at that moment**.
* Any **new inserts/updates in RDS after snapshot** won't exist in Aurora → risk of **data loss**.

So you are 100% correct: snapshot alone is **not enough** for minimal-downtime migration.

That's why big-tech style migrations always combine **snapshot + binlog replication (or DMS)**.

## 🔹 1. Correct Migration Flow (Snapshot + Binlogs)

1. **Take snapshot** of RDS MySQL
   * Restores quickly into Aurora → gives you a baseline copy.

2. **Enable binlog replication from RDS → Aurora**
   * Once Aurora is up from snapshot, set it as a **replica of RDS**.
   * Aurora now replays **all changes that happened after the snapshot** using binlogs.

3. **Catch up**
   * Aurora continuously applies new RDS transactions until lag = 0.

4. **Cutover**
   * Stop writes on RDS briefly.
   * Let Aurora apply last binlog entries.
   * Promote Aurora to standalone.
   * Point application to Aurora.

👉 This guarantees **Aurora = RDS** (no missing data).

## 🔹 2. Without Binlog Replication (Snapshot-Only Migration)

If you only use snapshot restore:
* You **must stop writes** on RDS before snapshot.
* Snapshot + restore → Aurora.
* Switch app to Aurora.

👉 That means **downtime = length of snapshot + restore** (hours for TB-sized DBs).

⚠️ **Too risky** for high-traffic systems.

## 🔹 3. Example: Orders Table

Let's say snapshot taken at **10:00 AM**.
* Snapshot has `orders` up to ID = 1,000,000.
* At **10:01 AM**, user places new order → `orders.id=1,000,001`.

👉 **If you just restore snapshot:**
* Aurora only has 1M rows (missing 1,000,001).
* **Data inconsistency**.

👉 **With binlog replication enabled:**
* Aurora replays that **order insert** from RDS binlogs.
* Now Aurora has all 1,000,001 orders.

## 🔹 4. Tools to Bridge Snapshot → Realtime

* **Native MySQL binlog replication** (Aurora supports it).
* **AWS DMS** (Database Migration Service) — streams changes continuously.
* **Aurora Migration Wizard** (internally combines snapshot + binlog sync).

## 🔹 5. Real-World Big-Tech Strategy

* **Snapshot** gives a **fast bulk copy** (saves time).
* **Binlogs / DMS** handle **ongoing deltas**.
* **Cutover** only when delta = 0.

This is exactly how companies like Amazon, Netflix, and Uber migrate massive prod DBs without downtime.

## ✅ **Answer:** 

Yes, snapshot alone will **miss new RDS writes**. That's why the standard approach is:

1. Take snapshot → restore Aurora (baseline).
2. Enable **ongoing replication** (binlogs or DMS) to sync new writes.
3. Once l
