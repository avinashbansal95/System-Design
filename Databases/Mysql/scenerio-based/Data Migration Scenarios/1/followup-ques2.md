how will aurora know that these are the binlogs after snapshot

# How Aurora Knows Where to Resume: Binlog Position Tracking

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Snapshot = Point-in-Time Copy

When you take a **snapshot** of RDS MySQL, AWS records:
* The **data state** at that exact moment.
* The **binlog position** (binary log file + offset) corresponding to that state.

This binlog position is like a **bookmark** in the transaction log.

Example: snapshot taken at 10:00 AM â†’ AWS notes:

```
Binlog file: mysql-bin.000123
Position: 45678
```

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Restore Snapshot â†’ Aurora

* When you restore into Aurora, you now have all data **up to 10:00 AM snapshot point**.
* Aurora is still missing all transactions after 10:00 AM.

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Configure Aurora as Replica of RDS

You tell Aurora:
* "Start replication from this binlog file + position."
* Aurora starts pulling binlogs from RDS beginning **right after snapshot bookmark**.

Example:

```sql
CALL mysql.rds_set_external_master (
  'rds-primary-endpoint', 3306,
  'replica_user', 'replica_pass',
  'mysql-bin.000123', 45678,
  0
);

CALL mysql.rds_start_replication;
```

Here, `'mysql-bin.000123', 45678` = snapshot's binlog position.

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Continuous Sync

* Aurora replays all changes from binlogs in order:
  * Inserts, updates, deletes made after snapshot.
* Keeps applying them until **Seconds_Behind_Master = 0**.
* At this point, Aurora = RDS.

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Cutover

* Stop writes briefly on RDS.
* Let Aurora catch up (final binlog events applied).
* Promote Aurora to primary.
* Point app traffic to Aurora endpoint.

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Analogy

Think of it like:
* **Snapshot** = a book with 100 pages.
* **Binlog bookmark** = "last word on page 100."
* **Aurora restores** up to page 100.
* **Then reads remaining pages** (binlogs) to catch up.

## ðŸ”¹ 7. Who Tracks Binlog Position?

* If you use **RDS snapshot + Aurora restore** â†’ AWS internally manages the binlog position for you (if you set Aurora as replica via console/CLI).
* If you use **DMS** â†’ DMS captures binlog position itself.
* If you **manually configure replication** â†’ you must provide binlog file + position when calling `rds_set_external_master`.

## âœ… **Answer:** 

Aurora knows where to resume because every RDS snapshot **records the binlog file + position at snapshot time**.

* When you restore Aurora and configure replication, you pass that binlog position.
* Aurora then replays only the changes **after the snapshot** from RDS binlogs, ensuring no data is missed.
