You need to migrate from RDS MySQL ‚Üí Aurora MySQL with minimal downtime. How do you do it? explain from scratch how to do that


# RDS MySQL to Aurora MySQL Migration Guide

## üîπ 1. Why Migrate from RDS MySQL ‚Üí Aurora MySQL?

Aurora gives:

- **Better performance** (3‚Äì5x vs RDS MySQL).
- **Near-zero replica lag** (shared storage).
- **Faster crash recovery** (no replay of binlogs).
- **Auto-scaling read replicas** (up to 15).
- **Global database support**.

But migration requires careful planning because **downtime is $$$**.

## üîπ 2. Migration Approaches

There are 3 main approaches (depending on downtime tolerance & scale):

### 1. Snapshot Restore ‚Üí Aurora
- Take RDS MySQL snapshot.
- Restore as Aurora cluster.
- Switch application endpoint.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Requires downtime** (during snapshot + restore).

### 2. Binlog Replication (Minimal Downtime) ‚úÖ
- Create Aurora MySQL cluster.
- Set Aurora as a read replica of RDS.
- Let it sync (apply binlogs).
- Promote Aurora to standalone cluster.
- Cutover app traffic to Aurora.

### 3. AWS DMS (Database Migration Service)
- Use DMS for ongoing replication from RDS ‚Üí Aurora.
- Cut over once lag = 0.
- Good for cross-engine migrations (e.g., MySQL ‚Üí PostgreSQL), but overhead for MySQL ‚Üí Aurora (binlog replication is simpler).

üëâ For MySQL ‚Üí Aurora, **option 2 (binlog replication)** is most common in production big-tech setups.

## üîπ 3. Step-by-Step Migration (Binlog Replication Method)

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Prepare RDS MySQL

Ensure binary logging is enabled.

In RDS Parameter Group:
```
binlog_format = ROW
binlog_row_image = FULL
```

- Ensure the RDS instance is stable (no high replication lag, backups working).
- Create a migration window (low traffic period).

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Create Aurora MySQL Cluster

1. Go to AWS RDS Console ‚Üí "Create Database."
2. Choose **Aurora MySQL** (compatible with your RDS MySQL version).
3. Choose cluster type:
   - Single region or Global Aurora (if multi-region).
4. Configure writer + reader instances.

üëâ Aurora cluster is empty at this point.

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Restore Data into Aurora

Two options:

**Option A: Snapshot restore**
- Take latest snapshot of RDS MySQL.
- Restore snapshot into Aurora.

**Option B: Fresh Aurora + Load Data**
- Create Aurora empty.
- Use `mysqldump` or AWS DMS to load schema + initial data.

üëâ **Snapshot restore** is faster for very large DBs.

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Enable Replication (Keep Aurora in Sync)

Configure Aurora to replicate from RDS using binlogs.

```sql
CALL mysql.rds_set_external_master (
  '<rds-endpoint>', 3306,
  '<repl_user>', '<repl_password>',
  'mysql-bin-changelog.000001', 4,
  0
);

CALL mysql.rds_start_replication;
```

Now Aurora continuously pulls changes from RDS.

üëâ At this point, **Aurora is a read replica** of your RDS MySQL.

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Sync & Monitor Replication Lag

Run:
```sql
SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G
```

Look for:
- `Seconds_Behind_Master` ‚Üí should trend to 0.
- In AWS CloudWatch: monitor `ReplicaLag`.

üëâ Wait until Aurora is **fully caught up** with RDS.

### ‚úÖ Step 6: Cutover (Minimal Downtime)

1. **Stop writes** to RDS temporarily (small maintenance window, e.g., 1‚Äì2 minutes).
2. Put app in **read-only mode** OR use feature flag to block writes.
3. Ensure **replication lag = 0**.
4. **Promote Aurora**:
   ```sql
   CALL mysql.rds_stop_replication;
   ```
5. **Point application** to Aurora writer endpoint (DNS switch).
6. In Kubernetes, update DB connection secret (`DB_HOST`).
7. **Redeploy pods** (rolling update).

üëâ **Downtime = only the small pause** during cutover.

### ‚úÖ Step 7: Verify

- Run app smoke tests (reads + writes).
- Check replication consistency (Aurora vs old RDS).
- Monitor CloudWatch: CPU, ReplicaLag, Queries.

### ‚úÖ Step 8: Decommission RDS MySQL

- Once stable ‚Üí shut down old RDS MySQL instance.
- Keep snapshot for backup.

## üîπ 4. Example Timeline (Minimal Downtime)

| Step | Action | Downtime |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Create Aurora cluster (empty) | None |
| 2 | Restore snapshot / load schema | None |
| 3 | Start replication from RDS ‚Üí Aurora | None |
| 4 | Wait for sync (Seconds_Behind_Master = 0) | None |
| 5 | Stop writes on RDS | ~1‚Äì2 minutes |
| 6 | Promote Aurora to primary | Few seconds |
| 7 | Update app endpoints (K8s secrets) | Rolling update |
| 8 | Resume writes on Aurora | Done |

## üîπ 5. Rollback Plan

If something fails post-cutover:

- **Switch app back** to RDS MySQL (DNS or secret).
- Since Aurora had been a replica, it won't be ahead ‚Üí **safe fallback**.
- Always keep RDS running until Aurora is stable for **at least a few days**.

## üîπ 6. Real-World Example (E-Commerce App)

- **RDS MySQL primary** ‚Üí handling 50k TPS writes.
- **Migration to Aurora MySQL** for scaling reads.

**Steps:**
1. Restore snapshot ‚Üí Aurora cluster.
2. Start binlog replication.
3. Let replication catch up overnight.
4. Cutover during 2am maintenance window ‚Üí **<1 min downtime**.

**Benefits:**
- Queries sped up by **3x**.
- Replica lag disappeared (Aurora storage model).

## ‚úÖ Summary

To migrate RDS MySQL ‚Üí Aurora MySQL with minimal downtime:

1. **Enable binlogs** on RDS.
2. **Create Aurora cluster**.
3. **Restore snapshot** or load schema/data.
4. **Set up replication** from RDS ‚Üí Aurora.
5. **Wait for Aurora to sync**.
6. **Stop writes briefly**, promote Aurora, update app endpoint.
7. **Verify, monitor**, and decommission RDS.
