# AWS DMS for Heterogeneous Database Migrations

This is where DMS moves from being "an option" to being absolutely essential. For a heterogeneous migration (e.g., Oracle → PostgreSQL, SQL Server → MySQL), the native binlog replication method completely breaks down.

Let's break down what you can't do and how DMS solves it.

## What You Cannot Do Without DMS (The Showstoppers)

### 1. Different Replication Protocols

**Problem:** Your summary relies on `CALL mysql.rds_set_external_master()`. This is a MySQL-specific command. An Oracle database doesn't produce MySQL binlogs, and a PostgreSQL target can't read them. The fundamental replication mechanism is incompatible.

**Without DMS:** You would have to build a custom application to read the source's transaction logs, convert the data, and apply it to the target. This is a massive, complex, and risky engineering project.

### 2. Different SQL Dialects & Data Types

**Problem:** The SQL syntax and data types are different between database engines.

- An `AUTO_INCREMENT` in MySQL is a `SERIAL` in PostgreSQL
- A `DATETIME` in MySQL might be a `TIMESTAMP` in Oracle
- The `SELECT * FROM table` query is the same, but the underlying system tables to discover schema are completely different

**Without DMS:** You would have to manually script the entire schema conversion, mapping every data type, rewriting stored procedures, triggers, and functions. This is incredibly time-consuming and error-prone.

### 3. Different Internal Page Formats

**Problem:** How data is stored on disk is proprietary to each database engine. A direct block-level copy is impossible.

**Without DMS:** You are forced to do a logical dump (using tools like `expdp` for Oracle or `pg_dump` for PostgreSQL) and then a load. This requires a very long downtime window as you must stop writes for the entire dump/load process.

## How AWS DMS Solves These Problems

DMS acts as a universal translator and replication engine. Here's what it provides for a heterogeneous migration:

### 1. Built-in Schema Conversion (The Killer Feature)

**AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT):** Often used alongside DMS, SCT can automatically analyze your source database (e.g., Oracle) and convert its schema, code objects (views, stored procedures), and data types to be compatible with the target (e.g., PostgreSQL).

**What it does:** It reads the source schema and generates the `CREATE TABLE` and `CREATE INDEX` statements for the target database. It handles the mapping of `NUMBER` to `INTEGER`, `VARCHAR2` to `VARCHAR`, etc.

### 2. Universal Replication Engine

DMS has built-in connectors to read the native transaction logs (redo logs, Write-Ahead Logs - WAL) from many sources (Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL) and apply them to many targets. It understands the different protocols, so you don't have to.

### 3. Continuous Data Replication

Just like with a homogeneous migration, DMS can perform an initial full load of the data and then continuously replicate changes using the source's transaction logs. This is what enables the minimal downtime model you want.

You don't have to stop writes for days while you dump and load terabytes of data.

## The Heterogeneous Migration Flow with DMS

Your summary would be transformed into this DMS-centric flow:

### Phase 1: Pre-Cutover (No Downtime)

1. **Use AWS SCT:** Convert your source schema (e.g., Oracle) to the target schema (e.g., PostgreSQL). This generates the scripts to create all tables, indexes, etc., in Aurora PostgreSQL.

2. **Create DMS Task:** Configure a DMS task with the following settings:
   - **Task mode:** Migrate existing data and replicate ongoing changes
   - **Source:** Your RDS Oracle endpoint
   - **Target:** Your empty Aurora PostgreSQL cluster
   - **Table mappings:** Define which tables to migrate

3. **Start the Task:** DMS will:
   - **Full Load:** Take a consistent snapshot of the source data and load it into the target
   - **CDC (Change Data Capture):** Once the full load is done, it will continuously read the Oracle redo logs and apply changes to Aurora PostgreSQL in near-real-time

### Phase 2: The Cutover (Minimal Downtime)

(This is very similar to your summary, but the "replication" is now managed by DMS)

1. Set feature flag `write_enabled=false`. (Downtime starts)
2. **Monitor DMS Metrics:** In the DMS console or CloudWatch, ensure `CDCLatencySource` is 0
3. **Stop the DMS Task.** This severs the replication link. Your Aurora database is now up-to-date and independent
4. Update Kubernetes Service to point to the new application deployment (the one designed for PostgreSQL)
5. Set feature flag `write_enabled=true`. (Downtime ends)

## Summary: DMS for Heterogeneous vs. Homogeneous

| | **Homogeneous Migration** (MySQL → Aurora MySQL) | **Heterogeneous Migration** (Oracle → Aurora PostgreSQL) |
|---|---|---|
| **Without DMS** | Possible & Preferred. Use native binlog replication. | Effectively Impossible. Requires building a custom replication tool. |
| **With DMS** | Possible. Adds cost and complexity for little benefit. | Essential. The only practical way to achieve a minimal-downtime migration. It automates schema conversion and data replication. |

In short: For a heterogeneous migration, DMS isn't just a helper; it's the fundamental engine that makes the entire minimal-downtime operation possible. It solves the unsolvable problems of protocol and schema incompatibility.
