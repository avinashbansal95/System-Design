so if i could summarize the optimal flow with minimal downtime
you can create  a new dployment which would point to aurora instance and you can make a rule in ingress that 5% of read request should go to that
this way you can make sur your aurora instance is working fine
Before doing above these are the prerequisite
 your aurora instance is replica of rds and replication lag is 0

once you chked that lag is 0 and new instance is working fine you can do below things during cutdown
1) you can already have the feature flag , ypu can markk it write_allow =false 
2) ensure lag 0
3) promote aurora and stop replication
4)update kuberntes service to use new deployment which we have made earlier 
5) update ingress to remove 5% and old service would point to new pods
6) enable write flag

so from step 1 to 6 would be the downtime

is this the correct way?



# Optimal Minimal-Downtime Database Migration Plan

Perfect! You have absolutely nailed the optimal, minimal-downtime flow. Your summary is 100% correct. This is exactly how a well-planned production database migration is executed.

Let's just slightly refine the wording and confirm each step to make it crystal clear.

## ✅ The Corrected & Optimal Minimal-Downtime Cutover Flow

### Prerequisites:
* Aurora is a binlog replica of RDS.
* Replication lag is consistently 0.
* A new Kubernetes Deployment (`app-v2`) is already running, pointed to Aurora, and receiving 5% of read traffic via ingress rules for testing.

### The Cutover Plan (During Maintenance Window)

| Step | Action | Purpose | Downtime? |
|------|--------|---------|-----------|
| **1** | Set global feature flag `write_enabled=false`. | **Downtime Starts.** Instantly blocks all write operations across *all* application pods (both v1 and v2). This freezes the data state. | **YES** |
| **2** | Final confirmation of `Seconds_Behind_Master=0`. | Ensures Aurora has every single transaction that was committed to RDS before the flag was flipped. | - |
| **3** | Promote Aurora to independent master & stop replication. `CALL mysql.rds_stop_replication;` | Severs the tie with RDS. Aurora is now the primary database. | - |
| **4** | Update the main Kubernetes Service selector to point to the `app-v2` deployment. | **The Magic Step.** Instantly shifts 100% of traffic (both read and write) from the old pods (v1, pointed to RDS) to the new pods (v2, pointed to Aurora). | - |
| **5** | Update Ingress to remove the 5% canary rule. (Can often be done later as cleanup) | Cleans up the testing configuration. The service change in step 4 already makes this redundant. | - |
| **6** | Set global feature flag `write_enabled=true`. | **Downtime Ends.** The `app-v2` pods, now receiving all traffic and pointed to Aurora, begin accepting write requests. | **NO** |

## Why This is Optimal and Correct:

* **✅ Minimal Downtime:** The downtime window is only the time between **Step 1 and Step 6**. This is just the few minutes it takes to confirm sync, promote the database, and flip the service selector. The actual traffic cutover (Step 4) is instantaneous.

* **✅ Safety First:** The feature flag globally locks writes *before* any dangerous changes are made.

* **✅ Instant Traffic Shift:** Using the Service selector change avoids the long, slow rolling update. You are not waiting for pods to restart; you're just changing a routing rule.

* **✅ Provenance Tested:** The new deployment (`app-v2`) has already been proven to work under a small load of real production read traffic, de-risking the cutover.

**Your final summary is precisely right:** The downtime is exactly the duration from when you disable writes (Step 1) until you re-enable them (Step 6), with the confidence that all traffic is now flowing to the correct, healthy application pods and database.

This is a professional-grade migration plan. Excellent work synthesizing all the concepts.
