et's imagine rds instance has one master and 3 replicas or read db , now we want to migrate it to aurora instance and wants to have same configuration
i understood that new aurora instance would be sync with rds throught binlogs, but how the aurora instance and it's replicas get in sync with primary aurora instance?
2) also would primary instance of aurora is sync with rds instance through bin logs?


# Deep Dive: Step-by-Step Migration (Binlog Replication Method)

**Scenario:** RDS MySQL with 1 writer and 3 read replicas → Aurora Cluster with 1 primary and 3 Aurora Replicas

## ✅ Step 1: Prepare the Source (RDS MySQL Cluster)

### Parameter Group
Ensure the RDS MySQL writer instance has the correct parameters. The replicas inherit this.

- `binlog_format = ROW` (Most reliable for replication)
- `binlog_row_image = FULL`

### Create a Replication User
On the RDS MySQL writer instance, create a user specifically for replication. This user will be used by Aurora to read the binlogs.

```sql
CREATE USER 'aurora_repl_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'a_very_strong_password_123!';
GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT, REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'aurora_repl_user'@'%';
```

**Note on Replicas:** You don't need to configure anything on the RDS read replicas for this migration. The entire migration process is between the RDS MySQL writer and the Aurora primary instance.

## ✅ Step 2: Create the Target (Aurora MySQL Cluster)

1. In the RDS Console, create a new database
2. Choose Amazon Aurora as the engine and the MySQL-compatible edition
3. In the "DB cluster identifier" field, enter a name (e.g., `my-aurora-cluster`). This is your cluster endpoint
4. Under "Instance configuration," create your instances:
   - Create one instance with "Instance role" as Writer (this will be your primary instance)
   - Create three more instances with "Instance role" as Reader (these will be your Aurora Replicas)
5. Configure the rest of the settings (VPC, security groups, etc.)

**Important:** It's crucial that the Aurora cluster can communicate with the RDS MySQL writer instance. Placing them in the same VPC and security group (or groups with rules allowing traffic on port 3306 between them) is the easiest way.

At this point, you have an empty Aurora cluster with one primary and three reader instances, all connected to a single, empty, shared storage volume.

## ✅ Step 3: Load Initial Data into Aurora

You need to get a full copy of your RDS data into Aurora. The binlog replication in the next step will only handle changes from that point forward.

### Best Method: Snapshot Restore

1. Take a final snapshot of your RDS MySQL writer instance
2. In the Aurora Console, find your cluster. Use the "Migrate snapshot" action or the "Restore snapshot" action, choosing the snapshot you just took

AWS will restore the data from the RDS snapshot directly into the Aurora cluster's shared storage. This data is instantly available to all instances in the cluster (the primary and all three replicas). There is no need to copy data to each instance individually.

## ✅ Step 4: Enable Binlog Replication (The Critical Step)

Now, you configure the Aurora primary instance to become a read replica of your RDS MySQL writer instance.

### Find the Binlog Coordinates
Connect to your RDS MySQL writer instance and run this command after the snapshot restore is complete. You need the current log file and position.

```sql
SHOW MASTER STATUS;
```

Note the `File` (e.g., `mysql-bin-changelog.000789`) and `Position` (e.g., `120`) values.

### Configure Aurora as a Replica
Connect to the endpoint of your Aurora primary instance (not the cluster reader endpoint) and run the special Amazon RDS procedure:

```sql
CALL mysql.rds_set_external_master (
  'your-rds-writer-endpoint.rds.amazonaws.com', 3306,
  'aurora_repl_user', 'a_very_strong_password_123!',
  'mysql-bin-changelog.000789', 120, -- Use the values from SHOW MASTER STATUS
  0
);

CALL mysql.rds_start_replication;
```

**What's happening now?** The Aurora primary instance is reading the binlogs from the RDS writer and applying those changes to the Aurora cluster's shared storage. Because the storage is shared, any data changes applied by the replication process are immediately available to all three Aurora Replicas. They don't need to run their own replication; they just read the updated data from the shared volume.

## ✅ Step 5: Monitor Replication Lag

Connect to the Aurora primary instance and check the replication status:

```sql
SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G
```

Look for `Seconds_Behind_Master`. Wait for this to be 0.

Also, monitor the `AuroraReplicaLag` and `ReplicaLag` metrics in CloudWatch for the Aurora primary instance. Wait for them to be 0.

## ✅ Step 6: The Cutover (Minimal Downtime)

1. **Place Application in Maintenance Mode:** Briefly make your application read-only to stop all writes to the RDS MySQL writer
2. **Final Sync:** Confirm `Seconds_Behind_Master` is 0. This ensures no last-second transactions are missing
3. **Stop Replication & Promote Aurora:**
   ```sql
   -- Run on the Aurora primary instance
   CALL mysql.rds_stop_replication;
   CALL mysql.rds_reset_external_master;
   ```
   Aurora is now a standalone, writeable cluster.
4. **Update Application Configuration:** Change your application's database connection string from the RDS writer endpoint to the Aurora Cluster Endpoint. This endpoint automatically directs write queries to the primary instance and read queries to the reader instances (if your application separates read/write connections)
5. **Disable Maintenance Mode:** Your app is now live on Aurora

## ✅ Step 7: Post-Migration & Cleanup

- Thoroughly test your application (both read and write operations)
- Update any other clients or services that connect to the database
- Once you are confident, you can delete the old RDS MySQL instance and its replicas to stop incurring costs. Always take a final snapshot before deletion for safety

## Direct Answers to Your Doubts

### 1. "How do the Aurora instance and its replicas get in sync with the primary Aurora instance?"

They do not sync with the primary instance. They sync with the shared storage volume. When the Aurora primary instance applies a write (either from your app or from the binlog replication), it doesn't write to its own local disk. It sends the write to the storage volume. The storage volume completes the write and propagates the data out to the underlying storage nodes. The Aurora Replicas are also connected to this same storage volume and read the results of the write directly from it. This is why Aurora replica lag is typically measured in milliseconds instead of seconds or minutes—it's a storage-level read, not a process of replaying binary logs.

### 2. "Would the primary instance of Aurora sync with the RDS instance through bin logs?"

Yes, but only during the migration phase. In our procedure, only the Aurora primary instance is configured as a replica of the RDS writer. It is the only instance in the Aurora cluster that reads the RDS binlogs. It applies those changes to the shared storage volume. Once the changes are in the shared storage, they are instantly available to all Aurora Replicas. The Aurora Replicas themselves have no knowledge of or connection to the RDS MySQL instance; they only see the data in the Aurora storage volume.

This is the beauty of the method: you only have to manage one replication link (RDS Writer → Aurora Primary), and Aurora's architecture handles the rest, making the migration to a multi-instance cluster simple and robust.
