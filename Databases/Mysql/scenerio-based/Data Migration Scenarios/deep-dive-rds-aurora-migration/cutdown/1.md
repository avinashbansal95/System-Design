so propose me the nest optimal way to cutover and with minimal downtime?
what to change and where to change and how much downtime would be there and when, assuming using kubernetes as orchestrator
also keep in mind we need to test out aurara first, do not blindly shift endpoint
we have node,js application

# The Optimal Minimal-Downtime Cutover Plan

**Primary Goal:** A sub-60-second window of write downtime.  
**Secondary Goal:** Fully test Aurora with production traffic *before* the final cutover.

## Phase 0: Prerequisites (Done Before Cutover Window)

1. **Binlog Replication is Running:** You've already set up Aurora as a replica of RDS and `Seconds_Behind_Master` is consistently 0.

2. **Secrets are Ready:** Two Kubernetes Secrets exist:
   - `rds-db-secret`: Points to your current RDS writer
   - `aurora-db-secret`: Points to your Aurora cluster endpoint

3. **Application Code is Ready (Critical):** Your Node.js app uses an environment variable (e.g., `DB_WRITE_ENDPOINT`) to decide where to write. This is key.

## Testing Aurora with Production Reads (True No Downtime)

The corrected strategy has two possible paths:

### Option A: The True Read-Only Canary (Most Common)

This is the standard, safe approach. We send **only read traffic (GET requests)** to the canary. We never send it any write traffic.

#### How it Works:

1. **Deploy the Canary:** Create a new deployment of your Node.js app (let's call it `app-canary`)

2. **Configure its Database:** This canary deployment uses the `aurora-db-secret`, so it connects to Aurora

3. **Identify it for Traffic Splitting:** Label this deployment so your ingress controller or service mesh can identify it (e.g., `version: canary`)

4. **Split Read Traffic:** Configure your **Istio VirtualService** or **Nginx Ingress** with a rule that says:
   "For all incoming HTTP GET requests, send 5% of them to the pods with the label `version: canary`. Send the other 95% of GET requests, and **100% of all POST/PUT/DELETE requests**, to the stable deployment."

#### Why it's Safe and Has Zero Downtime:

- **Users making reads (GET):** 5% of them will have their requests served by the app talking to Aurora. If there's an issue, only their page might load slowly or error, which is a minor impact.

- **Users making writes (POST/PUT/DELETE):** 0% of their traffic goes to the canary. Their experience is completely unchanged. Their writes go to the stable app, which writes to RDS, and the binlog replication carries that data to Aurora.

## Phase 3: The Cutover Process

1. **Enable Read-Only Mode on the OLD Setup (RDS):**
   - **Why?** To freeze the state of the world on the **RDS** database. This ensures no new data is written to RDS after we've confirmed it is fully in sync with Aurora. This is the start of the downtime.
   - **Action:** Flip the feature flag/ConfigMap. All your application pods, which are still connected to **RDS**, now block writes.

2. **Final Sync & Promote Aurora:**
   - Confirm `Seconds_Behind_Master: 0`. This means Aurora has every last transaction that was written to RDS *before* you enabled read-only mode.
   - Promote Aurora. It is now a standalone, writeable master. **RDS is now frozen and read-only.**

3. **Reconfigure and Restart Application Pods:**
   - You update the deployment to point to the `aurora-db-secret` and **crucially, you also disable the read-only mode configuration** in the same update.
   - Kubernetes begins a rolling restart. Pods are terminated and new ones are created.
   - **The new pods have two key changes:**
     - `DB_WRITE_ENDPOINT=aurora-cluster-endpoint`
     - `READ_ONLY_MODE=false` (or equivalent)

4. **New Pods Come Online:**
   - These new pods start up and connect to **Aurora**.
   - Because `READ_ONLY_MODE=false`, these pods **will accept write requests**.

5. **Disable Read-Only Mode at the Load Balancer / Feature Flag Service:**
   - **This is the key.** The "read-only mode" was enforced by your application code based on a config (e.g., a ConfigMap value, a feature flag service call).
   - Once you are confident the new pods are healthy and receiving traffic, you flip the *global* feature flag back to "writes enabled".
   - This tells your application code on all the new pods to **stop returning 503 and to start processing writes again**.
   - **This action ends the downtime**
