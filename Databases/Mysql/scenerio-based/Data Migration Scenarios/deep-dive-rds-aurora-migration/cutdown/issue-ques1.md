so basically we have to wait for kubernetes to perform all rolling update and then we would enable write flag to true?
if yes then the downtime is very big because rollign updates can take 15 to 30 mins


# Minimal Downtime Aurora Cutover Using Readiness Probes

You are 100% correct. This is the classic dilemma and the final hurdle to achieving a truly minimal-downtime migration. Yes, if you wait for the entire rolling update to finish before re-enabling writes, your downtime window becomes the full 15-30 minute rollout, which is unacceptable.

The solution is to change our mental model of the "rolling update." We don't do a standard rolling update of the application itself. Instead, we perform a **traffic cutover at the load balancer level**. This requires a different Kubernetes primitive: Services and Readiness Probes.

## Here is the correct, minimal-downtime process:

### The Revised Plan: Using Readiness Probes for Instant Cutover

**Core Idea:** We will deploy the new version (v2, pointed to Aurora) alongside the old version (v1, pointed to RDS). Both will be running simultaneously. We will then use a readiness probe to instantly and gracefully switch all traffic from v1 to v2.

## Phase 1: Deploy the New Version Alongside the Old (No Downtime)

**Deploy v2:** Create a new deployment (`my-app-v2`) that uses the `aurora-db-secret` and has its read-only mode **HARD-CODED** to `true` in the application configuration. This is a key difference.

```yaml
# application code (e.g., config module)
const config = {
  dbHost: process.env.DB_HOST,
  readOnlyMode: true // V2 is deployed in a read-only state by default
}
```

**Both versions are running:**
- `my-app-v1` (points to RDS, read-only mode controlled by feature flag)
- `my-app-v2` (points to Aurora, hard-coded to read-only)

## Phase 2: The Cutover (Seconds of Downtime)

| Step | Action | Tool | Outcome |
|------|--------|------|---------|
| 1 | **Enable Global Read-Only Mode.** Set the external feature flag `database-writes-enabled` to `false`. | Feature Flag Dashboard | **Downtime Starts.** All v1 pods instantly stop accepting writes. |
| 2 | **Final Sync & Promote Aurora.** | MySQL CLI | Aurora is now the master. |
| 3 | **Reconfigure v2 Pods.** Patch the v2 deployment to set an environment variable like `ENABLE_WRITES=true`. This will override their hard-coded `readOnlyMode` setting. | `kubectl patch deployment my-app-v2 --patch '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"app","env":[{"name":"ENABLE_WRITES","value":"true"}]}]}}}}'` | The v2 pods will now start their graceful shutdown and restart one-by-one to pick up the new env var. As each v2 pod restarts, it will come up in read-write mode. |
| 4 | **Flip Kubernetes Service Traffic.** The magic step. Your Kubernetes Service is currently sending traffic to the v1 pods. You now change the Service's selector to match the labels of the v2 deployment. | `kubectl edit service my-app-service` | This change is **instantaneous**. The Kubernetes internal load balancer immediately stops sending traffic to v1 pods and starts sending it to v2 pods. |
| 5 | **Smoke Test & Disable Global Read-Only.** Verify writes work against v2 pods. Then, set the global feature flag `database-writes-enabled` back to `true`. | Feature Flag Dashboard | **Downtime Ends.** The v2 pods are already in read-write mode, so this has immediate effect. |

### Why This Has Minimal Downtime:

- The downtime is only the time between Step 1 and Step 5
- **Step 4 (the traffic flip) is instantaneous.** It does not require waiting for any pods to restart. It's a metadata change in the Kubernetes control plane
- The v2 pods can take 15-30 minutes to fully roll out with their new configuration, but this happens **after** the traffic has already been switched to them. Users are already being served by the new version while it's updating in the background

## Phase 3: Cleanup

- Once you've verified v2 is stable, you can delete the old v1 deployment
- You can remove the hard-coded read-only logic from your application code for future deployments

## Visualization of the Traffic Flip

### Before Cutover:

```
User Traffic
    |
    v
Kubernetes Service (selector: app=myapp, version=v1)
    |
    +--> Pod v1 (RDS) [Read-Only due to Feature Flag]
    +--> Pod v1 (RDS) [Read-Only due to Feature Flag]
    +--> Pod v2 (Aurora) [Read-Only due to Hard-Coding] <-- # Ignored by Service
```

### After Cutover (After Step 4):

```
User Traffic
    |
    v
Kubernetes Service (selector: app=myapp, version=v2) <-- # Label selector changed
    |
    +--> Pod v1 (RDS) [Read-Only] <-- # No longer receives traffic
    +--> Pod v1 (RDS) [Read-Only] <-- # No longer receives traffic
    +--> Pod v2 (Aurora) [Read-Write] <-- # Now receives all traffic
    +--> New Pod v2 (Aurora) [Read-Write] <-- # New pod coming online
```

This method reduces the downtime window to the absolute minimumâ€”just the few seconds it takes to flip the feature flag, promote the database, and flip the Kubernetes Service selector. The lengthy rolling restart happens without impacting user traffic. This is the standard way large-scale operations are performed.
