n step 4 we already marked READ_ONLY_MODE=false so where in system we need to mark it disable?
does the old pod start accepting the write reuest, is that the fear?

# Aurora Cutover: Feature Flag Solution

That's the absolute core of the issue. You've identified the critical flaw in the plan. Yes, the fear is exactly that: the old pods, which are still running and connected to RDS, must not be allowed to accept writes.

The problem is that during a rolling update, both the old and new pods coexist. If you simply set `READ_ONLY_MODE=false` in the new pod configuration, you have a dangerous window:

- **New Pods (v2):** `READ_ONLY_MODE=false`, `DB_HOST=aurora` → Can write to Aurora
- **Old Pods (v1):** `READ_ONLY_MODE=true`, `DB_HOST=rds` → Can't write to RDS

**The Danger:** What if a user's session gets routed to an old pod (v1) after you've flipped the global switch? The old pod would get the command "writes are allowed," but it's still pointed at RDS, which is no longer the master. This would cause writes to be sent to the wrong database, leading to catastrophic data inconsistency.

## The Correct Solution: A Single Source of Truth

You **cannot** manage the read-only state via a configuration file inside the pod. You must control it through a **single, external source of truth** that all pods (old and new) check on every request.

This is where a **Feature Flag Service** (e.g., LaunchDarkly, Flagsmith, Split) or a centralized configuration system (like HashiCorp Consul) becomes essential for a robust cutover.

## Here is the corrected, professional flow:

### Phase 1: Before Cutover - Prepare the Flag

You create a feature flag called `database-writes-enabled`.

It is set to `true` during normal operation.

Your application code includes a check for this flag on every write request:

```javascript
app.post('/api/order', async (req, res) => {
  // Check the external feature flag service on every request
  if ( !(await featureFlagService.getFlag('database-writes-enabled')) ) {
    return res.status(503).json({ error: 'Database maintenance in progress' });
  }

  // ... proceed with the write operation to the database
});
```

### Phase 2: The Cutover Steps

| Step | Action | Tool | Outcome |
|------|--------|------|---------|
| 1 | Set global flag `database-writes-enabled` to `false`. | Feature Flag Service Dashboard | **Downtime Starts.** Instantly, every pod, old and new, immediately begins rejecting write requests and returning 503. It doesn't matter which database they point to. |
| 2 | Check Lag & Promote Aurora. | MySQL CLI | Aurora is now the master. |
| 3 | Update Application Deployment. Change only the `DB_WRITE_ENDPOINT` env var to the Aurora secret. | `kubectl set env` | The app now knows where to find the new database. We do NOT change the read-only logic here. |
| 4 | Perform Rolling Restart. | `kubectl rollout restart` | New pods start up with the Aurora endpoint. They still check the external feature flag, which is still `false`, so they still reject writes. |
| 5 | Smoke Test. | `curl` | Verify new pods can connect to Aurora. You can do a test write by temporarily skipping the flag check in a test endpoint. |
| 6 | Set global flag `database-writes-enabled` back to `true`. | Feature Flag Service Dashboard | **Downtime Ends.** Instantly, every pod, old and new, now accepts write requests. The old pods (v1) will write to RDS (wrong!). |

### Phase 3: The Final Cleanup (Avoiding the Danger)

The old pods (v1) are now **dangerous**. They are running old code that points to RDS, and the global flag now allows them to write.

This is why the **rolling restart is crucial**. You must let Kubernetes complete the rollout and terminate all the old v1 pods.

You must monitor the rollout status and ensure that 100% of your traffic is being served by the new v2 pods (which point to Aurora) before you consider the process complete.

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/my-app-deployment
```

Once the rollout is 100% complete, all old pods are gone. Only the new pods, pointed at Aurora, are running. Now it is safe.

## Summary: Why the External Flag is Non-Negotiable

**Instant, Global Control:** Flipping one external flag affects all pods instantly, which is impossible with a ConfigMap that requires a pod restart to pick up changes.

**Safety During Transition:** It keeps the application in a safe state (read-only) during the entire dangerous transition period, regardless of which pod version is running.

**No Ambiguity:** It eliminates the race condition you correctly identified, where different pods have different configurations.

The downtime is the time between flipping the flag to `false` and flipping it back to `true` after the rollout is verified to be complete. This is the only way to ensure no writes go to the old database.
