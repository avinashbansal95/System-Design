okay few doubts
since aurora replicas shared the same storage location, does not that location become bottleneck as all the data is going on shared location?, how does it scale?
becuase in rds we horizontal scaling using different instances but here data is going to same location?
also in aurora does each machine keep the data in the own disk or there is no concept of their own data, they just fetch it from shared location?

# Aurora Architecture Deep Dive

## 1. Is the Shared Storage a Bottleneck? How Does It Scale?

The short answer is **no**, it's designed not to be a bottleneck. In fact, it's the opposite: it's the reason Aurora can scale better than traditional architectures.

Think of the Aurora storage not as a single hard drive, but as a distributed, virtualized, and self-healing network service built for databases.

### Here's how it works and scales:

**It's a Distributed Network, Not a Single Disk:** The Aurora storage volume is striped across hundreds of storage nodes spread across multiple Availability Zones. This is not one big EBS volume; it's a massive distributed system.

**Massive Parallelism:** When the primary instance needs to write data, it doesn't send a single write to one disk. It sends the data to the storage layer, which fan-outs the write to many storage nodes simultaneously. Similarly, reads can be served by many nodes in parallel. This massively parallel processing is what allows it to handle enormous throughput.

**Quorums and Minimal Network Traffic:** Aurora uses a quorum-based model. For a write to be acknowledged as successful, it only needs to be persisted on a subset (a quorum) of the storage nodes, not all of them. This reduces latency. Furthermore, Aurora only sends the data pages that have changed, not the entire transaction log, over the network. This drastically reduces the I/O overhead compared to traditional MySQL replication.

**Auto-Scaling:** The storage volume automatically grows in increments of 10 GiB up to 128 TiB. You don't provision storage size or IOPS. Performance scales with the overall storage volume size.

### Analogy:

**RDS MySQL (with replicas)** is like a library with one master copy of a book (the writer). To get more people reading, you make 3 photocopies (the replicas) and put them on different tables. Making photocopies (replication) takes time and effort (replica lag), and if the master copy changes, your photocopies are out of date.

**Aurora** is like a library where the book exists as a single, magical, distributed entity. Every reader (Aurora instance) can instantly read from this single source of truth simultaneously without waiting for copies to be made. There is no lag because there are no copies to make.

## 2. Where is the Data? Do Aurora Instances Have Their Own Disk?

This is the critical architectural shift.

**Aurora database instances (Primary and Replicas) are effectively stateless.** They are compute instances, not storage instances.

They have local SSD storage (NVMe), but it is **NOT** used for customer data.

### What is the local SSD used for?

- **Caching:** The most important function. It caches frequently accessed data pages and query results. This is why Aurora replicas can serve read requests so quickly—they are often reading from their extremely fast local cache, not going over the network to the shared storage.

- **Temporary Space:** It holds temporary tables and sort areas for complex queries.

- **Log Files:** It stores the database's transaction logs before they are asynchronously pushed to the shared storage for durability.

The **"Source of Truth"** for all customer data is always the distributed, shared storage volume.

### Here is the flow for a WRITE operation:

1. Your application sends a COMMIT to the Aurora Primary Instance
2. The Primary Instance calculates the change and sends the relevant log records to the Shared Storage Volume
3. The Storage Volume persists the log records across its many nodes and acknowledges the write back to the Primary Instance
4. The Primary Instance then acknowledges the COMMIT back to your application
5. The Storage Volume asynchronously informs the Aurora Replica instances that their cached data pages might be stale. The replicas then invalidate their local cache for those pages

### Here is the flow for a READ operation on a Replica:

1. Your application sends a SELECT query to an Aurora Replica
2. The Replica first checks its local cache (on its fast NVMe SSD)
3. If the data is in the cache and not stale, it returns the result immediately. This is the fastest path
4. If the data is not in the cache or is stale, it fetches the required data pages from the Shared Storage Volume. It then caches them locally for future requests

## Summary: The Aurora Advantage

| Aspect | RDS MySQL (Traditional) | Aurora MySQL (Modern) |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| **Storage Model** | Each instance (writer + replicas) has its own dedicated EBS volume. | All instances share a single, distributed, virtualized storage volume. |
| **Replication** | Logical (Asynchronous): Data is copied by replaying SQL statements or row changes from the binary log. This creates replica lag. | Physical (Synchronous at storage level): Only the primary talks to storage. Replicas see the same data instantly. Near-zero lag. |
| **Scaling Reads** | Add a new replica → must copy all data to a new EBS volume (slow provisioning) and then continuously replicate changes. | Add a new replica → it's just a new compute instance that connects to the existing shared storage. Provisioning is very fast (minutes). |
| **Instance Role** | Stateful: Instance and storage are tightly coupled. | Stateless (Compute-Only): Instance can fail, and a new one can be started that immediately connects to the shared storage. |
| **Crash Recovery** | Slow. Must replay the transaction log (innodb redo logs) on startup to ensure data consistency. | Fast. The distributed storage is already consistent. The database instance just needs to start up. |

So, to directly answer your final question: There is **no concept of "their own data"** for customer data. The shared storage is the single source of truth. The instances are powerful compute and cache nodes that access this shared truth, which is how Aurora achieves its incredible performance, scalability, and low replication lag.
