i have a question , since default isolation level in mysql is REPEATABLE READ, so we might not be having READ UNCOMMITTED,READ COMMITTED isolation level anyway? only way to do that is explictly tell to use but why would you do that?

# MySQL Isolation Levels - Practical Usage and Trade-offs

## ðŸ“Œ 1. Default Isolation Level in MySQL

* Yes âœ…: By default, InnoDB runs at **REPEATABLE READ**.
* So if you don't explicitly set anything â†’ no dirty reads, no non-repeatable reads.

## ðŸ“Œ 2. Do Other Levels Exist?

Yes âœ…: All 4 ANSI levels exist in InnoDB.
* You can change it **globally** or **per-session**:

```sql
-- Session level
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;

-- Global default
SET GLOBAL TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
```

## ðŸ“Œ 3. Why Would You Use Lower Levels?

### âš¡ READ UNCOMMITTED
* Rare in production (because dirty reads are almost always bad).
* Sometimes used for:
   * **Debugging** or quick reporting queries where consistency doesn't matter.
   * Certain analytics queries where stale/dirty data is acceptable.

### âš¡ READ COMMITTED
* More common!
* Even though REPEATABLE READ is the default, some systems explicitly use **READ COMMITTED** because:
   1. **Fewer locks held** â†’ better concurrency.
   2. Prevents "gap locks" that REPEATABLE READ uses for phantom prevention.
   3. Behavior matches other RDBMS (Oracle, PostgreSQL).

ðŸ‘‰ Example: In high-throughput OLTP apps (banking, ticketing), developers often want to avoid long-running REPEATABLE READ snapshots that may block new inserts/updates. READ COMMITTED reduces contention.

## ðŸ“Œ 4. Why Not Always Stay with REPEATABLE READ?

* Because **REPEATABLE READ snapshots last until transaction ends**.
* In long transactions:
   * You might be reading very old data.
   * Undo log grows large to maintain older versions.
* READ COMMITTED avoids this â†’ each statement sees the latest committed data.

ðŸ‘‰ So it's a **trade-off**:
* REPEATABLE READ â†’ stronger consistency, heavier overhead.
* READ COMMITTED â†’ fresher reads, better concurrency, slightly weaker guarantees.

## ðŸ“Œ 5. Real-World Example

### Banking System (READ COMMITTED)
* Balance check query should always show the **latest committed balance**, not an old snapshot from minutes ago.
* Here, **READ COMMITTED** is chosen to give up repeatable reads in favor of **freshness**.

### Analytics Dashboard (READ UNCOMMITTED)
* A reporting query runs across millions of rows.
* Exact correctness not critical â†’ even if some rows are being updated, approximate values are fine.
* **READ UNCOMMITTED** avoids unnecessary locks â†’ faster query.

## ðŸŽ¯ Interview-Safe Answer

Even though MySQL's default is REPEATABLE READ, you can explicitly choose READ COMMITTED or READ UNCOMMITTED. READ COMMITTED is actually quite common in high-concurrency OLTP apps because it reduces locking and ensures queries always see the latest committed data, matching the behavior of Oracle and PostgreSQL. READ UNCOMMITTED is rarely used, but sometimes chosen for analytics or reporting queries where dirty reads don't matter. So the choice depends on whether your priority is **consistency** (REPEATABLE READ) or **concurrency/freshness** (READ COMMITTED).
