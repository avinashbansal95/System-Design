that means postgres i better for race conditon without locking?

# Why Postgres is Safer Than MySQL for Race Conditions (by Default)

💡 Exactly — you've nailed the key point:

👉 **Postgres (default = READ COMMITTED) is *safer* than MySQL (default = REPEATABLE READ) in certain race conditions, even without explicit row locks.**

Let me explain why 👇

## 📌 Why Postgres Handles Race Conditions Better (by Default)

### 🔑 MySQL (default = REPEATABLE READ)

* Snapshot is taken **at transaction start**.
* Reads don't see changes made by other committed transactions.
* So if two users both see "seat=free" at the beginning, both may try to update → **silent overbooking**.
* Both updates succeed unless you add explicit locks or unique constraints.

### 🔑 Postgres (default = READ COMMITTED)

* Snapshot is taken **per statement**.
* Every new query inside a transaction sees the latest committed data.
* So if Transaction B books the seat first, then when Transaction A tries to book, Postgres sees the conflict and throws an error:

```
ERROR: could not serialize access due to concurrent update
```

* Only one booking succeeds → **no silent overbooking**.

## 📌 But — Important Caveat 🚨

While Postgres is safer by default, this doesn't mean you should *never* lock.

* Postgres **avoids silent corruption** but still needs `FOR UPDATE` or constraints if you want strict correctness in business logic.
* Why? Because:
  * Postgres will throw a conflict error, but your app must **catch it and retry** the transaction.
  * If you don't retry properly → users may see "Booking failed" instead of "Seat already booked."

👉 MySQL silently allows double booking (worse).  
👉 Postgres blocks it with an error, but you must handle retries (still some overhead).

## 📌 Example: Node.js Flow

### MySQL (default RR, without locking)

```javascript
// Both users may succeed → overbooking ❌
```

### Postgres (default RC, without locking)

```javascript
try {
  await client.query("BEGIN");
  await client.query("UPDATE seats SET status='booked' WHERE id=1");
  await client.query("COMMIT");
} catch (err) {
  console.error("Booking failed:", err.message); 
  // must handle retry or fail gracefully
}
```

👉 Postgres prevents overbooking **by erroring**, but you need retry logic.

## 📌 Summary Table

| DB/Default Level | Dirty Read | Non-repeatable Read | Race Condition (seat booking) |
|------------------|------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| **MySQL (RR)** | ❌ Prevented | ❌ Prevented | ❌ Allows silent overbooking |
| **Postgres (RC)** | ❌ Prevented | ✅ Allowed | ✅ Throws conflict, no silent overbooking |

## 🎯 Interview-Safe Answer

Yes — Postgres is safer for race conditions like seat booking by default. In its READ COMMITTED isolation, every statement sees the latest committed data, so if one transaction books a seat, another concurrent transaction's update will fail with a conflict. MySQL's default REPEATABLE READ takes a snapshot at transaction start, so both transactions can see the seat as free and both succeed, leading to silent overbooking. That's why in MySQL you must use `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` or constraints. In Postgres you should still lock or implement retries, but the default avoids silent corruption.
