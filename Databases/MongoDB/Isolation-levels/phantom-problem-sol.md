# How MySQL Solves the Ticket Booking Problem with SERIALIZABLE Isolation

## üîê Transaction Isolation in MySQL

MySQL supports multiple **transaction isolation levels**, including `SERIALIZABLE` ‚Äî the strongest level, which ensures complete isolation between concurrent transactions.

At the `SERIALIZABLE` level:
- All reads are performed with **range locking**.
- Any `SELECT` within a transaction behaves as if it places locks on the rows it reads ‚Äî and even on gaps where new rows could be inserted.
- This prevents **phantom reads** (new rows appearing during a transaction).
- It ensures data consistency and enforces business rules (e.g., max 100 tickets).

> ‚úÖ **Result**: Prevents overbooking by serializing access to critical sections.
