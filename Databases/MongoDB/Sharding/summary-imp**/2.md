let's say when collection is being we said we want 3 shards and does not specify shard key range . we only told the shardkey now intitally a write operation is mnade it would be in shardA so when does new shardB being live ? how it is decided


# ðŸ“Œ Initial State When You Shard a Collection

When you shard a collection:

```javascript
sh.shardCollection("shop.orders", { userId: 1 })
```

* You specify a **shard key** (`userId`).
* At first, the **entire range** `{ MinKey â†’ MaxKey }` is a **single chunk**.
* That single chunk is assigned to **one shard** (say Shard A).
* Metadata in config servers:

```javascript
{ "ns": "shop.orders", "min": { "userId": MinKey }, "max": { "userId": MaxKey }, "shard": "shardA" }
```

ðŸ‘‰ So yes: the **first writes go only to Shard A**, because it owns the entire range.

# ðŸ“Œ When Do Other Shards (B, C) Come Alive?

Other shards start receiving data **only after balancing kicks in**. This happens when:

1. **Chunks grow beyond the threshold (64MB)** â†’ MongoDB splits the chunk into smaller ranges.
   * Example:

   ```javascript
   { MinKey â†’ 0 } â†’ Shard A  
   { 0 â†’ MaxKey } â†’ Shard A  
   ```

2. **Balancer detects imbalance** â†’ migrates chunks from Shard A â†’ Shard B or Shard C.
   * After migration:

   ```javascript
   { MinKey â†’ 0 } â†’ Shard A  
   { 0 â†’ MaxKey } â†’ Shard B
   ```

3. Now, queries/inserts with `userId` in `{ 0 â†’ MaxKey }` will go to **Shard B**.

ðŸ‘‰ This is when **Shard B becomes "live."**

# ðŸ“Œ Example Walkthrough (3 Shards)

1. **Initial:**
   ```javascript
   { MinKey â†’ MaxKey } â†’ Shard A
   ```

2. **After 100MB of inserts:**
   ```javascript
   { MinKey â†’ 0 } â†’ Shard A
   { 0 â†’ MaxKey } â†’ Shard A
   ```

3. **Balancer notices Shard A has 2 chunks, Shard B & C have 0 â†’ imbalance. It migrates:**
   ```javascript
   { 0 â†’ MaxKey } â†’ Shard B
   ```

4. **More inserts keep coming â†’ `{ 0 â†’ MaxKey }` exceeds 64MB â†’ split again:**
   ```javascript
   { 0 â†’ 5000 } â†’ Shard B
   { 5000 â†’ MaxKey } â†’ Shard B
   ```

5. **Balancer now moves `{ 5000 â†’ MaxKey }` to Shard C.**
   ```javascript
   { MinKey â†’ 0 }     â†’ Shard A
   { 0 â†’ 5000 }       â†’ Shard B
   { 5000 â†’ MaxKey }  â†’ Shard C
   ```

ðŸ‘‰ Now **all three shards are live** and receiving writes/queries.

# ðŸ“Œ Important Notes

* **New shards don't immediately start getting writes**.
   * They only receive data once chunks are split and migrated.
* **If your shard key is bad** (like monotonically increasing `_id`), all new inserts go into the "last chunk" â†’ one shard becomes a hotspot.
   * Example: All new docs go into `{ 5000 â†’ MaxKey }`, which might still be on Shard B until the balancer moves it.

# ðŸŽ¯ Interview-Safe Answer

When you create a sharded collection with 3 shards, only one shard initially owns the entire chunk `{MinKey â†’ MaxKey}`. That means all writes go to Shard A at first. Shard B and C don't become active until chunks grow beyond the 64MB threshold, splits occur, and the balancer migrates chunks to those shards. At that point, queries and writes for those ranges are routed to Shard B and C. In short, new shards become "live" only when the balancer redistributes data to them.
