so who decide how many shard would eb there?
as far as i understood , range of shrdkey decided by config server and could be change over time when rebalcming takes place

# Who Decides How Many Shards and Shard Key Ranges?

## ðŸ”‘ 1. Who decides how many shards?

* **You (the DBA / architect / cluster admin)** decide how many shards to add to a cluster.
* When setting up a sharded cluster, you start with some number of shards (usually 2â€“3), but you can **add shards at any time**:

```javascript
sh.addShard("shard01.example.net:27018")
sh.addShard("shard02.example.net:27018")
```

* Each **shard is itself a replica set** (for durability + HA).
* So, the number of shards is entirely under your control, based on:
   * Data volume (storage scaling).
   * Query throughput (performance scaling).
   * Business requirements (geo-partitioning, compliance).

ðŸ‘‰ MongoDB does **not auto-create shards** â€” you add them.

## ðŸ”‘ 2. Who decides shard key ranges?

* **Config servers** manage **metadata about chunks**:
   * Each chunk = contiguous range of shard key values.
   * At collection creation, the whole range is `{MinKey â†’ MaxKey}`.
   * As data grows, when a chunk exceeds ~64MB, mongos requests a **split**.
   * Config servers update metadata to reflect new ranges (e.g., `{MinKey â†’ 1000}`, `{1000 â†’ 2000}`, `{2000 â†’ MaxKey}`).

ðŸ‘‰ So **split points are decided automatically by MongoDB** based on data growth.

## ðŸ”‘ 3. How balancing changes ranges

* Splitting just divides ranges; it doesn't move them.
* If one shard has more chunks than another, the **Balancer** (orchestrated by config servers) moves chunks between shards.
* Migration changes **which shard owns which chunk**, but the **ranges themselves stay fixed once split**.

ðŸ‘‰ **Example flow:**

1. **Start:**
   ```javascript
   { MinKey â†’ MaxKey } â†’ Shard A
   ```

2. **After inserts:**
   ```javascript
   { MinKey â†’ 1000 } â†’ Shard A
   { 1000 â†’ MaxKey } â†’ Shard A
   ```

3. **Balancer moves:**
   ```javascript
   { MinKey â†’ 1000 } â†’ Shard A
   { 1000 â†’ MaxKey } â†’ Shard B
   ```

4. **More growth in `{1000 â†’ MaxKey}` â†’ split again:**
   ```javascript
   { MinKey â†’ 1000 } â†’ Shard A
   { 1000 â†’ 2000 } â†’ Shard B
   { 2000 â†’ MaxKey } â†’ Shard B (later might move to Shard C if imbalance detected)
   ```

## ðŸŽ¯ Interview-Safe Answer

The number of shards in a MongoDB cluster is decided by the cluster admin â€” you explicitly add shards based on scaling needs. MongoDB does not auto-create shards. Once sharding is enabled, the config servers manage shard key ranges. Initially, there is one range `{MinKey â†’ MaxKey}`; as chunks grow past the 64MB threshold, MongoDB automatically splits them into smaller ranges. The balancer process then redistributes these chunks across shards if imbalance occurs, but the split ranges themselves are fixed once created.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also explain **how MongoDB decides which shard a new document goes to** (using the shard key â†’ hashed/range mapping â†’ chunk ownership)? That's often a follow-up in interviews.
