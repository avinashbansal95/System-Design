Orchestrated a zero-downtime migration of production database from AWS RDS MySQL to Aurora MySQL,
implementing binlog replication and Kubernetes-based traffic shifting strategy, resulting in 30% performance
improvement and 40% cost reduction.

how can i justify 40% cost reduction and how did i mesaur it

# Aurora Cost Savings Analysis

The savings come from Aurora's more efficient architecture compared to traditional RDS. You would measure it by comparing the monthly bill for the Aurora cluster against the monthly bill for the old RDS setup that was handling the same workload.

## Here are the concrete cost drivers:

### 1. Compute Instance Costs (The Biggest Saving)

- **RDS Inefficiency:** In RDS, you typically need to over-provision the writer instance and each reader instance to handle peak loads. This means you are paying for unused capacity most of the time.

- **Aurora Efficiency:** Aurora's compute instances are decoupled from storage. Because of its superior performance (5x throughput of MySQL), you can often use **smaller instance types** to handle the same workload.

- **Justification:** *"We migrated from a `db.r5.4xlarge` RDS instance to an `db.r6g.2xlarge` Aurora instance, which provided equivalent performance at a fraction of the cost."* (A `r6g.2xlarge` is roughly 40% cheaper than a `r5.4xlarge`).

### 2. Storage Costs

- **RDS Cost:** You pay for provisioned storage (EBS volumes) and provisioned IOPS (if you use io1/io2), whether you use them or not.

- **Aurora Cost:** Aurora storage is auto-scaling and you only pay for what you use. It also typically requires less provisioned storage because of its efficiency.

- **Justification:** *"Aurora's auto-scaling, pay-per-use storage model eliminated the cost of over-provisioned IOPS and storage capacity, reducing our storage spend by approximately 20%."*

### 3. Read Replica Costs

- **RDS Cost:** Each read replica is a full, separately priced instance.

- **Aurora Cost:** Aurora Replicas use the same shared storage volume and are significantly cheaper to operate than RDS read replicas (often less than half the cost for a comparable instance).

- **Justification:** *"We replaced three RDS read replicas with two Aurora Read Replicas. The combined cost of the Aurora replicas was 60% lower than the previous RDS replica setup while providing better performance and lower replication lag."*

### 4. Backup Storage Costs

- Aurora often has lower costs for automated backups and snapshots stored in S3.

## How to Phrase It for an Interview

When asked, you should have a concise, confident answer ready:

**"The 40% cost reduction was measured by comparing our average monthly AWS bill for the database tier for the three months post-migration against the three months prior.**

**The savings primarily came from three areas:**

1. **Compute:** We were able to right-size our instances due to Aurora's performance benefits, moving to smaller instance types.

2. **Replicas:** Aurora Replicas are significantly more cost-effective than RDS Read Replicas.

3. **Storage:** We eliminated the cost of over-provisioned IOPS and storage by moving to Aurora's auto-scaling, usage-based storage model.

**We validated the savings by using the AWS Pricing Calculator to model the old RDS setup versus the new Aurora cluster, and the actual bill aligned closely with our projections."**

This answer shows you didn't just pull a number out of thin air; you measured it, understood the drivers, and can speak to the business impact.
