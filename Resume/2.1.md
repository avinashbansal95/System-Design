how to measure 1m users per min

1. Application throughput in New Relic APM

By default, New Relic APM collects:

Requests per minute (RPM) for your app â†’ shown right on the APM summary screen.

Transactions per minute (TPM) broken down by endpoint.

You can filter by appName and transaction name.

ðŸ‘‰ Example NRQL query:

SELECT rate(count(*), 1 minute) 
FROM Transaction 
WHERE appName = 'MyApp'
SINCE 10 minutes ago


rate(count(*), 1 minute) gives requests per minute.

You can FACET name to see per-endpoint RPM.

SELECT rate(count(*), 1 minute) 
FROM Transaction 
WHERE appName = 'MyApp'
FACET name
SINCE 10 minutes ago

---output

name	rate(count(*), 1 minute)
WebTransaction/Expressjs/GET//api/v1/users	12,000
WebTransaction/Expressjs/POST//api/v1/orders	8,500
WebTransaction/Expressjs/GET//api/v1/items	15,200
Other	5,300
