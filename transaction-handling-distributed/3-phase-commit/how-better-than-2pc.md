# Three-Phase Commit (3PC) vs Two-Phase Commit (2PC): Deep Dive

Let's deep dive into how Three-Phase Commit (3PC) improves upon Two-Phase Commit (2PC) — specifically in the coordinator crash scenario — using the flight booking example we discussed.

We'll focus on:

- ❌ The problem in 2PC when coordinator crashes
- ✅ How 3PC solves it
- 🔄 What participants do in 3PC when coordinator disappears
- 🧠 Real example walkthrough

## ❌ Problem with 2PC: Coordinator Crash = Indefinite Blocking

### Scenario in 2PC (Flight Booking)

1. All participants (Flight & Payment) voted **Yes** in Prepare Phase.
2. Coordinator sends commit → but crashes after sending to only one participant.
3. One participant (e.g., Payment) commits, but the other (Flight) never receives the decision.

### 🚫 Result:
- Flight Service is stuck in an **uncertain state**.
- It knows it voted Yes, but doesn't know if the transaction was committed or aborted.
- It cannot decide what to do → must wait forever for the coordinator.
- ❌ **Indefinite blocking** → system hangs.

**This is the biggest flaw of 2PC: a single coordinator failure can block the entire system.**

## ✅ How 3PC Solves This: The "Pre-Commit" Safety Net

3PC introduces a third phase — **Pre-Commit** — to eliminate the ambiguous state.

### The key idea:

🔑 **Once all participants have entered the "pre-commit" state, they all know that everyone else is ready to commit. So, even if the coordinator crashes, they can safely proceed to commit.**

## 🔁 3PC States & Guarantees

| Phase | Can Abort? | Can Commit? | Can Decide on Timeout? |
|-------|------------|-------------|----------------------|
| After Prepare | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| After Pre-Commit | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (eventually) | ✅ Yes (on timeout) |
| After Commit | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | — |

### 🎯 Key Guarantee:
If a participant receives **pre-commit**, it knows all other participants also received **pre-commit** (because coordinator only sends it after all Yes votes).

**So, everyone is ready → no one will abort → safe to commit on timeout.**

## 🧩 Real Example: Coordinator Crashes After Pre-Commit

Let's say in our flight booking system:

### ✅ Phase 1 (Prepare):
- **Flight Service**: reserves seat → votes **Yes**
- **Payment Service**: reserves funds → votes **Yes**
- Coordinator receives both **Yes**.

### ✅ Phase 2 (Pre-Commit):
- Coordinator sends **pre-commit** to both.
- Both services acknowledge and enter **pre-committed** state.
- ✅ **Now both know: everyone is ready.**

### 💥 Coordinator crashes before sending doCommit.

## 🆘 What Happens Now?

### ✅ Flight Service (Participant) Logic on Recovery:

```javascript
// flightService.js
checkPendingTransactions();
// Finds: bookingId=X is in "pre-committed" state, but no final decision

const lastHeartbeat = getLastCoordinatorSignal();
if (Date.now() - lastHeartbeat > TIMEOUT) {
  // Coordinator is dead — but we were pre-committed
  // So we KNOW it was going to commit
  commitTransaction(bookingId);
  updateStatus('confirmed');
}
```

### ✅ Payment Service does the same:
Sees it was in **pre-commit** → waits for coordinator → timeout → **commits autonomously**.

**✅ Both services eventually commit without the coordinator!**

## 🔁 Why Is This Safe?

Because of the design of 3PC:

1. The coordinator only sends **pre-commit** if **all participants voted Yes**.
2. So, when a participant receives **pre-commit**, it knows:
   - ✅ Everyone else also voted **Yes**.
   - ✅ No one will abort.
   - ✅ The only possible decision was **commit**.
3. Therefore, on timeout, it can **safely commit**.

## 🔄 What If Coordinator Crashes Earlier?

| When Coordinator Crashes | What Participants Do |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| **Before prepare** | Participants never started → **safe to abort** |
| **After prepare, before pre-commit** | Participants wait; if timeout, they can **abort** (since not all may have agreed) |
| **After pre-commit** | Participants **timeout and commit** (safe, because all were ready) |

**✅ This eliminates indefinite blocking in two critical cases.**

## ⚖️ Key Difference: 2PC vs 3PC on Coordinator Crash

| Scenario | 2PC Behavior | 3PC Behavior |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Coordinator crashes after prepare** | Participants **block forever** | Can **abort on timeout** |
| **Coordinator crashes after pre-commit** | Participants **block forever** | Can **commit on timeout** |
| **All participants ready** | No autonomy | **Autonomous decision possible** |
| **Fault Tolerance** | ❌ Low | ✅ Improved (but not perfect) |

## ⚠️ But Wait: Why Isn't 3PC Used in Practice?

Even though 3PC solves the blocking problem, it has major practical limitations:

### 🌐 Assumes No Network Partitions
- Requires **bounded network delays** — unrealistic in cloud environments.

### ⏱️ Relies on Accurate Timeouts
- Hard to set globally; false positives can cause **inconsistent commits**.

### 📡 Assumes Reliable Failure Detection
- Hard to distinguish between **slow node** and **dead node**.

### 🧱 Complex to Implement
- Needs persistent logs, state machines, timeouts, recovery logic.

### 🚫 Still Not Fully Fault-Tolerant
- Can fail in **asymmetric network partitions**.

**🔑 That's why systems use Paxos, Raft, or Saga patterns instead — they handle partitions and failures more robustly.**

## ✅ Summary: How 3PC Solves 2PC's Problem

| Issue | 2PC | 3PC |
|-------|-----|-----|
| **Coordinator crashes after prepare** | ❌ Participants block forever | ✅ Can abort on timeout |
| **Coordinator crashes after pre-commit** | ❌ Participants block forever | ✅ Can commit on timeout |
| **Participants can decide alone?** | ❌ Never | ✅ Yes, in safe states |
| **Eliminates ambiguous state?** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes, via **pre-commit** |

**✅ 3PC removes the "I don't know what to do" state by introducing a safe pre-commit phase.**

## 🎯 Final Takeaway

**3PC is a theoretical improvement over 2PC** — it reduces blocking and allows autonomous decisions in safe states.

But due to unrealistic assumptions about networks and timing, **it's not used in real systems**.

### 🧠 Still worth knowing because:

- It shows how to **design around blocking**.
- It leads to better ideas like **consensus algorithms (Raft)** and **saga patterns**.
